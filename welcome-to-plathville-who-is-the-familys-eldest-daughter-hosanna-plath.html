With tensions rising high between the three eldest Plath kids, Ethan, Micah, and Moriah, parents Kim and Barry are determined to mend their family once and for all, and have their tight-knit circle back together. While they continue to make sense of their children’s choices, a Plath family reunion doesn’t appear to be happening anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is Ethan and Olivia struggling with issues in their own marriage, but their issues with the family have reached an all-time high, so much that they’ve cut all communication with Kim and Barry. Fans of the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> TLC show</a> are gaining more and more insight into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Plath family</a> dynamic, leading many viewers to wonder why the eldest Plath, Hosanna, is nowhere to be found. Hosanna is talked about and shown in photos on the show, but has yet to make an appearance, and here’s why!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Of Our Favorite TLC Shows Of All Time (5 We Wish Never Existed)</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-hosanna-plath>Who Is Hosanna Plath?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hosanna-Plath-Moriah-Plath-welcome-to-plathville-e1605671526330.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'Welcome To Plathville' is well underway and fans cannot get enough of season 2! While the show's return wasn't announced until this year, viewers were worried that this TLC series was bound to be a one-hit-wonder, however, not only are they back, but they are back and better than ever! Last week, fans were updated on the Plath family situation, learning that the eldest Plath children, Ethan, Micah, and Moriah, are all living on their own away from their parents. Despite living blocks away from one another, the kids are determined to gain their own independence as they navigate the real world.</p><p>During tonight's episode, Moriah opened up about having her first boyfriend, and the struggle of having him meet her parents for the first time. While all eyes were on Moriah and boyfriend, Max Kallschmidty tonight, it seems as if fans are wondering about another Plath family member, Hosanna Plath! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hosanna is the eldest girl of the bunch</a>, however, she is not referred to as so in the TLC series. Not only is Hosanna disregarded as the eldest Plath, but she is nowhere to be seen, and fans want to know why. It's become clear that Hosanna does not live in Georgia with the rest of her family, she and her husband, Timothy Noble, currently reside in Ohio!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Bizarre TLC Shows You Forgot Existed</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hosanna-Plath-Timothy-Noble-National-Quarter-Convention.jpg><p>Hosanna has been shown in photos and was talked about briefly during the first episode of season 1, however, that is about the only time viewers were given any details about Hosanna. Well, it turns out, the 21-year-old is not only living it up in Ohio, but she is living it up on tour! Hosanna and Timothy are a duo act that tour across the United States showcasing their musical talents. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hosanna is a professionally trained violinist</a>, while hubby Tim is a pianist, guitarist, and trained vocalist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hosanna's career is one of the biggest reasons why she does not appear on the show, despite viewers thinking that she too left the farm out of rebellion. While she certainly has a better perception of the real world compared to her younger siblings, Hosanna still has a very close relationship with her family and keeps in close communication with parents, Kim and Barry.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Does TLC’s Jon Gosselin Speak To Any Of His Kids?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiunqSTpLqmedOoZKmkkam1t7XLpZxmr5ikeqq%2FjK2fnmWWlrqquNisZJ6klJrAtXnDmqygoKSav260zqyYp6aRYr2trdOhZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
