The singer proved you can mix patterns and prints when she stepped out for a date night with boyfriend <a href=#><strong>A$AP Rocky</strong></a>.</p><p>The lovebirds, who <a href=#>welcomed their first child together</a> — a baby boy — in May, were spotted grabbing dinner in New York on Tuesday, August 23, in coordinated looks. For her part, Rihanna, 34, managed to make a busy outfit look chic. The “What’s My Name” artist started her ensemble off with an oversized blue Jersey, which she paired with baggy green and black checkered pants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Rihanna-Rocks-Clogs-Football-Jersey-0004.jpg><p>She accessorized the look with a snakeskin handbag from Gucci x Tom Ford. On her feet, the Barbados native sported clogs by Gucci x Adidas. Rihanna topped the outfit off with white sunglasses and had her hair styled in shaggy waves.</p><p>Debunking fashion myths is a habit for the “Needed Me” musician. She often <a href=#>pushes the envelope</a> with bold outfits that include contrasting colors and textures. She also makes statements with her mane and glam, rocking vibrant lip colors and different hairstyles.</p><p>Rocky, 33, also breaks fashion barriers. The “Purple Swag” rapper matched Rihanna for their late-night outing, rocking Gucci logo-print trousers and a crisp white T-shirt. He finalized his look with a gold chain necklace, a black baseball cap and blue and white sneakers.</p><p>The couple’s outing comes after Rocky <a href=#>pleaded not guilty</a> to two counts of assault with a firearm over a November 2021 incident in Los Angeles. Rocky appeared in court on August 17, and the judge issued a restraining order stating the rapper must stay 100 yards away from the victim. The New York Native has been accused of shooting his friend last year. A preliminary trial is set for November 2, 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly first reported that Rihanna and Rocky were “hooking up” in February 2020 and he <a href=#>confirmed the romance</a> in May of that year.</p><p>“[It’s] so much better when you got The One. She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones,” Rocky told <a href=#>GQ</a> at the time, describing Rihanna as “the love of my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6e2qa3Np5hmqp%2BYuLR5wGadqKekl66tuIyjnKurla56orrDZpqhnZOgsrOxw2anmqakqHqxtM6tpmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
