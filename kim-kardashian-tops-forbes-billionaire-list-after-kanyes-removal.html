But one person who didn’t make the cut was her ex-husband, Kanye West, despite being featured in the exclusive report many times in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were a number of famous faces who made the list, including rapper Jay-Z in 1,217th place, with a net worth of $2.5 billion.</p><p>Rihanna was also mentioned in the Forbes report. The Fenty founder came in 2,002 place with a net worth of $1.4 billion. Other celebs who made the billionaire’s list include Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, and Steven Spielberg.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Travis Scott Pays Big To Avoid Lawsuit After Nightclub Assault</a></span></p><p>For her part, Kim came in at the 2,259th spot. She has a reported net worth of $1.2 billion, largely thanks to her successful clothing and shapewear line SKIMS.</p><p>Kim’s ex-husband Kanye West was stripped of his billionaire status last year after losing his long-time partnership with Adidas. The company was pressured to cut ties with Ye after he made a series of anti-semitic and anti-Black comments in interviews and online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Subsequently, Forbes made a report stating that <a href=#>Kanye no longer qualified as a billionaire</a>, since the Yeezy x Adidas collaboration accounted for $1.5 billion of his net worth.</p><p>Ye lost a variety of collaborations and patronships in the wake of his controversial behavior. Brands like <a href=#>Gap and Footlocker refused to work with him</a> or carry his products, while fashion icons like <a href=#>Vogue and Anna Wintour reportedly severed ties</a>, as well.</p><p>As a result, Kanye is reportedly experiencing a variety of financial problems. In December, it was reported his brand <a href=#>Yeezy was evicted from its headquarters</a> after falling behind on rent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, the rapper has apparently made a series of <a href=#>undisclosed payments to former employees</a> over allegations of workplace discrimination and harassment. He’s also facing a lawsuit over similar claims.</p><p>In fact, Kanye is in the midst of several lawsuit, including a <a href=#>$250 million defamation case filed by George Floyd’s family</a>. The Yeezy founder is also being <a href=#>sued by his ex-manager for breach of contract</a>. However, the <a href=#>manager’s legal has apparently had trouble reaching Ye</a> to serve him with papers, thus stalling the case.</p><p>Despite his financial problems, Kanye recently agreed to <a href=#>pay Kim Kardashian $200,000 a month</a> in child support for their four children, whom he’s previously <a href=#>admitted stay with their mother “80% of the time.”</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Lana Del Rey Gets Engaged With $300,000 Diamond Ring</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>NY Post</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWarqKijYrOwvsGeqmaamaG5qrvNmqCrnV2htrTAjJqdrZ2iYriiutieqmaqlaK8t63LaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
