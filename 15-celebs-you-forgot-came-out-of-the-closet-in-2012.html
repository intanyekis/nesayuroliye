Each season there are new scandals and tabloid stories, but some of the most empowering media blitzes are those that surround a celebrity embracing their sexuality and coming out of the closet. In some cases the celebrity was never hiding their sexuality, it just wasn’t an issue that they thought had to be announced publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other more tragic cases involve someone getting outed with scandal or being forced out of the closet by bloggers in the way that Lance Bass was. But however the person came out, the fact that they celebrated their sexuality openly likely served as an inspiration for a kid out there that was too scared to tell the truth to their own loved ones. In 2012 society started to see homosexual people as equals instead of ‘not to be talked about’ scourges on society.</p><p>Fights for gay rights had been long underway and people were just starting to listen. This list of LGBTQ celebs has helped to create a positive view of gay people in Hollywood which only added to the fight as gay marriage became legal in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-paul-iacono><strong>15.

Iacono attended Professional Performing Arts School in New York where he first met one of his future costars Paul McGill (Fame).</p><p>In a Springtime interview with Michael Musco of The Village Voice Iacono revealed that he was gay. He is currently dating Mason Amelotte, a student at Columbia University. The year after his interview with Musco Iacono was put on OUT Magazine’s 100 Most Influential LGBTQ people of 2013. The young man has been an activist for gay rights since coming out and remains an influential member of the queer community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-gillian-anderson><strong>14.

Although she identifies now as completely heterosexual, the actress isn’t opposed to taking on a same-sex relationship in the future. Basically, if two human beings become interested in each other she sees no issue with them exploring that despite their gender.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-wade-davis><strong>13.

Mitch from Paranorman</strong></h2><p>When Paramount Pictures released Paranorman&nbsp;the right wing blew a gasket over Mitch, the first openly gay animated character to hit the big screen. The writer and director of the animated feature about zombies Chris Butler said that featuring Mitch in the story goes with the theme of Paranorman: breaking through stereotypes and misconceptions. They wanted us to look at zombies that we usually think are going to eat our brains and think for a minute, check out the dumb jock neighbor and realize that he could also be a gay man; the creators of the film wanted to challenge our smaller views of the world. There were mixed reviews about Mitch when the film came out but ultimately Paranorman&nbsp;was still a modest box office success. In 2013 GLAAD nominated ParaNorman&nbsp;for its&nbsp;GLAAD Media Awards, and in the process made it the very first PG animated movie to be nominated at this awards ceremony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-paul-babeu><strong>6.

A few days after this revealing media blitz Babeu spoke up and claimed that he was in fact gay and that was the only true fact in Jose Orozco’s story.
