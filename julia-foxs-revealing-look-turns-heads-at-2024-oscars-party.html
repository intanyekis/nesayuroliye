She also opted for a crimped, wet-look hairstyle for the star-studded event.</p><p>This certainly isn’t the first time Fox has showcased a unique look for fans. While attending the snowy Sundance Film Festival in Utah in January, the model tried to stay warm in a white, knit <a href=# rel=noopener>two-piece bikini</a> over a black turtleneck catsuit.</p><p>And in October 2023, the <i>OMG Fashun!</i> star <a href=#>flashed her underwear</a> in a fiery red dress.</p><p>When asked about her fashion picks, Fox explained that she never dresses for the male gaze.</p><p>“Men hate my outfits,” Fox said at the time while appearing on <a href=# rel=noopener>BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour</a>. “They’re so mad that I’m not like how I was on Uncut Gems. I hear that all the time, but I don’t care … because the girls love it. The girls and the gays love it!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Julia-Fox-Revealing-Look-Turns-Heads-at-2024-Oscars-Party-3.jpg><p>Fox, who is a mom to 2-year-old son Valentino with ex <strong>Peter Artemiev</strong>, has been on a mission to defy expectations when it comes to fashion and outfits.</p><p>“Whether I was realizing it or not, I think my appearance is very much to please the male gaze in a way, and then something happened, I don’t know if it was motherhood or being thrust into the public eye,” she explained. “I was just like, ‘I don’t want to uphold this anymore.’ I want to dress for the girls, and that’s really who I am.”</p><p>While not every look will receive two thumbs up from followers, Fox assures fans that she is staying true to herself and having a little fun in the process.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“People get so, so mad about my outfits,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Cosmopolitan</i></a> in November 2023. “The response is way crazier than the outfit itself!”</p><p>And for women thinking about stepping out of their comfort zone and trying something new in fashion, Fox makes it clear that she will be supportive.</p><p>“Women’s bodies should be celebrated and shouldn’t just be viewed as sexual objects,” she told the publication. “Anyone getting mad at me for showing a lot of skin has slapped this label on me … but I’m so much more than that. Why wouldn’t I wear something revealing, really cool and artsy?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2FCrbXAZp2osKNiv6bCxJqjoqaXYrmwu8pmq66qnqh6qbHAnapmmaRif3F%2Bk2amrJuRp8BuvMCrq7Jn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
