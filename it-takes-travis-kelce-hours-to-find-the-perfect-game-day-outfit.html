I kind of enjoy the creative process of the panic to just throw something together.”</p><p>The Chiefs tight end went on to share that he mainly chooses clothes that “put a smile on somebody’s face.”</p><p>“Obviously, not every look is for everybody,” Kelce told the outlet. “I’m not going to be offended if somebody says I look like a clown if I got a fun hat on and some wacky jeans. It is what it is, I’m gonna have fun with it.”</p><p>Kelce’s style frequently gets noticed ahead of every Kansas City Chiefs game, especially in his<a href=#> designer two-piece ensembles</a>.</p><p>“Without a doubt, I think the football world is starting to kind of come around to being that fashion-forward mentality,” Kelce told<a href=# rel=noopener> Complex </a>magazine in September 2021. “And our game days are 16, 17 weeks, now 18 weeks out of the year. So it’s like we get, almost, anticipation for those big-time moments. It’s almost like it’s a red carpet every single week.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-Takes-At-Least-3-Hours-to-Pick-An-Outfit-Before-Heading-into-Chiefs-Locker-Room-500.jpg><p>He continued: “I know in Kansas City, we have to be business casual [in] slacks. You can’t go full jeans and a T-shirt on an away game. Like, you have to actually dress business casual. So I think it’s a little bit more of a red carpet on the week-to-week and regular-season games in the NFL. And I don’t know, it’s just been a whole lot of fun kind of being in the mix of all that.”</p><p>Kelce and his wardrobe has especially been making headlines throughout the past month amid his new romance with <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>.</p><p>The pair fueled romance rumors after Swift, 33, <a href=#>attended Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs game</a> in September. After the game, Kelce and the “Lavender Haze” singer were<a href=#> spotted leaving the locker room together.</a> The football player wore a <a href=#>funky blue and white set</a> featuring an abstract painted design of nude female figures — a bold choice that perfectly reflected the same colors as Swift’s upcoming album, <a href=#>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</a>. The brand — KidSuper Studios — <a href=# rel=noopener>renamed the ensemble </a>from “Bedroom Painting Denim Jacket” to the “1989 Bedroom Painting Denim Jacket.”)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the couple were spotted together<a href=#> cozying up later that night</a>, they had their<a href=#> first public outing</a> nearly one month later.</p><p>On Saturday, October 14, Swift and Kelce were spotted holding hands in New York after their respective cameos on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>. Kelce wore a cream-colored jacket with blue bird imagery on the front with matching brown slacks. Swift, for her part, stunned in a black corset top, black trousers and a plaid coat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX57BbsDApJysZaSnrre10mainqSTmnqpu9Srqmasn2KzqrrDZquhnV2lsrOyxJyrZp%2BRorJusMCyZKitpJu2tXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
