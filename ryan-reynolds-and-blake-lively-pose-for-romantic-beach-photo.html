Reynolds wore a white long-sleeved shirt and tan trousers while Lively stunned in a white sundress. They stood in the sand and smiled for the camera at golden hour with a rainbow stretching behind them.</p><p>“Thank you 2023 part 1. In no real order,” Reynolds captioned a set of 10 pictures via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “I got to spend most of the year working and playing with the people I ❤️❤️.”</p><p>Elsewhere in his look back, Reynolds included a photo from his famous night out with <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> at <a href=#>an October Chiefs v. Jets game</a>, severals snaps from Wrexham games, a behind-the-scenes look at his <a href=#>Just Friends reunion</a> with costar <strong>Amy Smart</strong> and a photo of himself pumping iron at the gym with <a href=#>trainer <strong>Don Saladino</strong></a>.</p><p>He started his “2023 part deux” post with a selfie of himself and Lively on the pitch at Wrexham Stadium in Wales. Deadpool director <strong>Shawn Levy</strong>, <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong>, <strong>Rob McElhenney</strong> and a call to donate to the Canada’s Hospital for Sick Children.</p><p>The pair had a big year as they welcomed their fourth child last February. They haven’t announced the name or sex of the baby. Lively and Reynolds also share daughters James, 8, Inez, 6 and Betty, 3.</p><p>“We’re very excited. Look, we wouldn’t do this four times if we didn’t love it,” Reynolds joked during CNBC’s Power Lunch broadcast shortly after the baby’s birth. “Everybody’s doing great. Everybody’s actually doing fantastic.”</p><p>The power couple’s careers are going to make 2024 a busy year. First, Reynolds’ <a href=#>movie IF</a> is set to hit theaters in May. The film follows a young girl (<strong>Cailey Fleming</strong>) who develops the ability to see all of the Imaginary Friends in the world, most of whom were discarded. She and Reynolds’ character go on a mission to reconnect them.</p><p>Then, the highly-anticipated Deadpool 3 will hit theaters in July. The movie finally unites Reynolds’ Wade Wilson with Jackman’s Wolverine and brings Deadpool into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>His Hulu docuseries, Welcome to Wrexham, is expected to return for a third season sometime in 2024 as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lively is working on her adaptation of <strong>Colleen Hoover</strong>‘s <a href=#>It Ends With Us</a>.
