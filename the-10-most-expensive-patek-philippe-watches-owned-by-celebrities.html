Whether they're shelling out cash for their watch designs or spending on a watch for a loved one, your favorite actors and artists are making waves in the watch industry for their <a href=#>expensive tastes for the rare timepieces</a>.</p><p>Patek Philippe is a maker of luxury timepieces adored by the stars. They are the last independent, family-owned Genevan manufacturer, pursuing traditional Genevan watchmaking techniques since 1839. From research and development to design and manufacturing, all their timepieces are created in-house from beginning to end. This means that Patek Philippe has complete creative control over all of their watches, allowing them to create some truly exceptional pieces. Here are 10 of the most expensive Patek Philippe watches owned by celebrities:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="A Peek Inside The Simple Yet Stylish Watch Collection Of Ryan Gosling" href=#>A Peek Inside The Simple Yet Stylish Watch Collection Of Ryan Gosling</a></p><h2 id=john-mayer-s-patek-philippe-perpetual-calendar-chronograph-5970g>John Mayer’s Patek Philippe Perpetual Calendar Chronograph 5970G</h2><p>Now for a slightly different take. John Mayer has one of the finest watch collections, not just of any musician but any celebrity. Despite avoiding bling, his wrist-mounted portfolio is into the tens of millions, containing the kind of watches that make collectors weep. Take the crown jewel of his collection as an example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Patek Philippe Perpetual Calendar Chronograph</a>. At just over $100,000, this watch has a long way to go before it reaches the heights hip-hoppers crave, but it's not all about the money. But it is a tough timepiece for someone who genuinely appreciates watch making's fine art.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-s-patek-philippe-minute-repeater>Angelina Jolie’s Patek Philippe Minute Repeater</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This Patek Philippe Minute Repeater was an engagement gift from Brad Pitt, who is famous for his love of Patek Philippe timepieces. This particular model from the luxury brand is a remarkable piece: the 33 mm officer's-style case houses the watch's ultra-thin movement and each of the tiny steel mallets that produce the watch's chiming sound. This $390,000 self-winding minute repeater is the first-ever model made for women and features a gold and mother-of-pearl dial. Pitt decided to give the piece to Jolie as a pre-wedding gift, and he was lucky enough to skip the two-year-long waiting list and receive it within two months.</p><h2 id=kevin-hart-s-patek-philippe-celestial-6102r>Kevin Hart’s Patek Philippe Celestial 6102R</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Patek Philippe Celestial is one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grande complications of the house</a>, whose watches are already among the best in the world. And one of the actors who owns watches of this brand is Kevin Hart who has<a href=#> starred in numerous highest grossing films</a>. What makes this watch from 2015 stand out is the fact that the dial has been enhanced with a rotating chart of stars, allowing Hart to admire the exact configuration of the nocturnal sky in the northern hemisphere. As such, Ref. 6102R joins the historic ranks of astronomical Patek Philippe watches. However, what looks spectacular also comes at a price: Due to its intricate mechanism and 44mm rose gold case, the watch comes with a hefty cost of $432,000.</p><h2 id=charlie-sheen-s-patek-philippe-reference-2438-1>Charlie Sheen’s Patek Philippe Reference 2438/1</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlie Sheen has undoubtedly had his ups and downs and he is <a href=#>notoriously known in Hollywood as a d-bag</a>, but he has consistently been an avid watch collector, especially Patek Philippe watches. After losing his Ref. 5970, Sheen decided to add a scarce and expensive model to his collection. He replaced the lost model with a Patek Philippe Perpetual Calendar Ref. 2438/1. This limited-edition model includes a day/date complication, a moon phase dial, and outer Arabic five-minute divisions. The watch is estimated to be worth around $700,000.</p><h2 id=drake-s-patek-phillippe-40th-anniversary-edition-nautilus>Drake’s Patek Phillippe "40th Anniversary Edition" Nautilus</h2><p>You know the Nautilus: the unexpected grail watch leads ordinary collectors to suck up to boutiques and wait years to get their hands on it. In other words: extraordinary. Well, even extraordinary doesn't quite cut it for Drake. Drake’s 40th Anniversary Edition Nautilus only has 1,300 pieces made for their 40th-anniversary model that were released in 2016. The watch is embossed with a series of numbers (1976-40-2016) commemorating the anniversary, and ten diamonds stand in for hour markers. The watch costs about $835,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-sheeran-s-5208p-grand-complication>Ed Sheeran’s 5208p Grand Complication</h2><p>Sheeran is a big Patek Philippe fan and in general, the<a href=#> English singer-songwriter owns a extravagant watch collection</a>. In addition to the typical Nautilus, Sheeran has been wearing multiple complications. One such watch is the Patek Philippe Ref. 5370 split-seconds chronograph. This classic piece will cost you around $250,000 on the secondary market.Perhaps Sheeran's most out-of-this-world Patek is his Ref. 5208P-001 Grand Complication Minute Repeater Perpetual Calendar. This piece is 42mm and has a platinum case. If you want to purchase your Grand Complication, be prepared to spend some cash. This piece is priced at around $1.8 million on the market.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner-s-18kt-white-gold-patek-philippe>Kylie Jenner's 18KT White Gold Patek Philippe</h2><p>Makeup mogul Kylie Jenner is also a luxury watch collector, and her 18KT White Gold Patek Philippe is a testament that money can buy you class, sometimes. Even at the age of 22, Kylie is one of the most influential personalities in the world. With over 180 million followers on Instagram, Kylie can cut a heavy cheque by simply sharing her next upload on the photo and video sharing platform. This means that the $2 million amount she used to purchase her Patek Philippe watch did not put a dent on her bank account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jay-z-s-patek-philippe>Jay Z's Patek Philippe</h2><p>In his own words, Hova can skip a leg day but will still run the world. Rap legend and one of the greatest rappers since hip hop's inception, Jay Z is a name that needs no introduction. Celebrating the birthday of rap icon Sean Combs aka Diddy, the Roc Nation founder married to Beyonce, arrived in a typical Hova style. Jay Z was sporting a $2.2 million Patek Philippe watch at the gala event. They added it in Patek Philippe's 175th-anniversary celebration, the Grandmaster Chime ref. 6300G timepiece is the second chronicle of the Grandmaster Chime.</p><h2 id=eric-clapton-s-patek-philippe-2499>Eric Clapton’s Patek Philippe 2499</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rather than bling, Eric Clapton’s priciest watch of choice is pure class, favoring rarity over diamonds. The English Guitarist<a href=#> owns a lot of luxurious things</a> and one of them is the Patek Philippe 2499 which is a holy grail even among Patek Philippe collectors, as it's only one of two in the world to be put into a platinum case. The only other example anywhere is safeguarded in the Patek Philippe museum. Of course, even the non-platinum versions of 2499 are pricey, but this is something else. They never sold it on the open market, and it came into Clapton's hands courtesy of Christie's Geneva. The price he paid for the watch is $3.6 million. Given its new provenance, it’s likely worth a lot more now.</p><h2 id=brad-pitt-s-patek-philippe-5016a>Brad Pitt’s Patek Philippe 5016A</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Sun, they sold the Patek Philippe 5016A to none other than Hollywood superstar Brad Pitt. The watch was at sale at the Only Watch auction, which raises money for research on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. This year the auction raised $11.2 million – over half of it from Brad Pitt's extravagant purchase. The name of the man who purchased the watch wasn't the only exciting thing to be revealed. It also turned out that Pitt bought the watch as a gift for his then-wife, actress Angelina Jolie.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Ways Brad Pitt Earns and Spends His Fortune" href=#>10 Ways Brad Pitt Earns and Spends His Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifestyle Asia</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">First Class Watches UK</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hodinkee</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmpZ%2BowW6x16mcp6uZq7JuvMCtnKRloJ22rbXPqZxmr5GpsKmx0mamsKaVmXqjxYycnKWdkqe2tbXErGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
