I probably realized that too late—not that it would’ve affected my decisions in terms of who I dated, but it would’ve affected my decision to appear on the show. At the time, I didn’t think anyone would even care. To this day, people will still say, ‘You ruined Rob’s life!’ and I’ll think, Damn, I was still playing with Barbie dolls when I met him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>While Adrienne has long since moved on with her current boyfriend Lenny of five years, she did admit that it did bother her that people blamed her for their eventual split.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She told the mag, “It’s common knowledge that he cheated on me, and it always bothered me that people were like, ‘Pero, why couldn’t you forgive him?’ Why are women always the ones who have to forgive? If you cheated on a man, he would be like, ‘You’re disgusting, and I want nothing to do with you.’ &nbsp;But women, we’re supposed to be like, ‘He messed up. He made a mistake.’ And, in my situation, it wasn’t like, ‘Oh my God! I made a mistake!’ He strategically planned things out so that he could cheat on me, and that to me was so disloyal.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The comments that Latina shared EXCLUSIVELY&nbsp;with <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> shed further light on<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Adrienne’s&nbsp;troubled relationship with Rob.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Imagine that you realize, maybe I didn’t make the best decision, maybe this wasn’t the best person for me, but I’m going to try to make it work. We’re so different. The way we were raised was so different,” Adrienne explained. “Our thought process — we’re just opposites.&nbsp;So I had realized that and was trying to make it work, and then you [cheat on]&nbsp;me? Oh no, I’m done. I’m&nbsp;through. I was like, ‘I’m trying to make this work. I feel bad,&nbsp;and I want to make it work. I have your name on my a**. I want to make it work.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Although Adrienne has had a very successful and versatile career in TV, film,&nbsp;and music, she tells the mag that there is still one thing she craves — a family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“If by some miracle we started taping The Real in New York tomorrow, I’d marry him, like, right now. I want a family. I see my sister and she’s on her second baby, and I’m like, That’s success. Having a family—I can’t wait for that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Hopefully, we will get to hear all about her relationship with Lenny when The Talk airs this fall.</p><h3>Adrienne Bailon Gets Rob Kardashian Tattoo Removed</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>Six years after their breakup, Adrienne has finally tried to get the tattoo of Rob’s name removed — from her tush! The stunner has tried twice before and has unfortunately been unsuccessful both times.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>This time, she brought <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Extra</a>, along with her, where she opens up about her journey to have it removed for good. As <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>previously reported</a>, she is no longer a fan of it. “Not my favorite tattoo,” she admits. “I’ve waited for a really long time — long enough — to have this officially gone.&nbsp;I’ve actually had two sessions before this and I’d come home and see no difference and it looks like I just got a fresh tattoo.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Luckily, Lenny supports his lady, and while he wouldn’t mind seeing it removed, he is more concerned for what the process will be like for her skin. Adrienne admitted, “He wants it to be done right, and it won’t be something that will damage my skin and I’ll be scarred for life,” she says during the interview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>We are so glad that Adrienne is comfortable opening up in such a big way. We applaud Adrienne for being so open with her feelings.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>What do YOU think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Do you think Adrienne hit Rob below the belt?</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>— Caitlin Beck</strong></p><h3>More Adrienne Bailon & Rob Kardashian News:</h3><li><a href=#>Adrienne Bailon Erases Rob Kardashian — Removing Butt Tattoo</a></li><li>‘KUWTK’: Kris Jenner Ignored Rob Kardashian’s Weight Problems</li><li>Cheryl Burke On Rob Kardashian’s Weight: I’ll Dance With Him To Help</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH14e5FyZpqcop6yr7rEZpmaoZyku26wyKyqnqtdp7yjecqaqZ2Zo522orqMpZitoZ6Weq6txpqxoqaVYravwMSrraKdp2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
