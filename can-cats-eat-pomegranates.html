But can cats eat pomegranates? Are pomegranates safe for cats?</span></p><p><span>With all the health benefits found in pomegranates, including fiber and vitamin C, you may be tempted to treat your cat to pomegranate too. </span><b>In small amounts, pomegranates are safe for cats and may even have health benefits.</b><span> That said, remember that cats are obligate carnivores, and too much of any fruit, including pomegranates, is not healthy for them.</span></p><p><span>In this article, we look at the potential benefits of feeding pomegranates to your feline, how much is safe, and the potential risks involved in feeding them this delicious fruit. Let’s get started!</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><h2><span id=Potential_benefits_of_feeding_pomegranate_to_your_cat>Potential benefits of feeding pomegranate to your cat</span></h2><p><span>First of all, pomegranate is not toxic to your feline, so while there is a bit of a risk of feeding them too much, the fruit is perfectly safe and even nutritious in small amounts. The fruit is low in calories and free from saturated fats and cholesterol, making it a safe, low-calorie snack.</span></p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow><span>Pomegranates</span></a><span> are loaded with natural vitamin C, a potent antioxidant that combats the oxidization of cells and promotes overall health.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64><p><span>That said, cats synthesize their own</span><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow> <span>vitamin C in the liver</span></a><span>, meaning that additional vitamin C is not essential and should be kept to natural sources, like pomegranate.</span></p><p><span>Pomegranates are also a source of anthocyanins, an antioxidant and antiinflammatory present in some red, purple, and blue fruits such as blueberries. Antioxidants prevent the free radical damage to cells. Moreover, </span><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow><span>experimental studies in laboratory animals</span></a><span> suggest that anthocyanins help to reverse gastric ulcers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another potential benefit is that pomegranates contain some fiber, which can help improve your cat’s digestion and gut health. Although cats are carnivores and in the wild would get all the fiber that they need from the</span><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> <span>fur</span></a><span> of their prey, most domestic cats need a small amount of</span><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow> <span>additional fiber in their diet</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Pomegranates are also a source of potassium, which plays an essential role in several body functions, including the regulation of electrical impulses between the nerves and muscles. </span><span>is&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Pomegranates also have a high water content, which is a great way to give your feline extra hydration in the summer months.</span></p><h2><span id=Potential_health_risks_of_feeding_pomegranates_to_cats>Potential health risks of feeding pomegranates to cats</span></h2><p><span>While pomegranates are non-toxic, there are still risks associated with giving them to your cat. Cats are obligate carnivores, and too much of any fruit is not ideal. Pomegranates are lower in sugar than some other common fruits, but they still have enough to cause potential problems for felines, especially</span><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> <span>cats that are diabetic</span></a><span> or have weight issues. In excess, they can also cause digestive problems in cats, potentially causing loose stools and diarrhea.</span></p><p><span>The fresh fruit from pomegranates is best for your cat, and you should avoid juices or processed pomegranates, as these often contain even more sugar and often have added preservatives, colorants, and even flavorings. Since cats do not chew on their food, pomegranate seeds could represent a hazard. It is safer to put them in the blender before offering them to your cat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Remember that pomegranates and any other fruit should be given as occasional treats only and cannot replace any part of your cat’s nutritional needs.</span></p><h2><span id=Can_cats_eat_other_fruits>Can cats eat other fruits?</span></h2><p><span>While fruits are not essential in a cat’s diet, there are a few that are perfectly safe in small amounts and can even have potential health benefits.</span></p><p>These include:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><ul><li>Apples</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Strawberries</li></ul><h2><span id=Fruits_to_avoid_at_all_costs_include>Fruits to avoid at all costs include:</span></h2><ul><li>Grapes (and raisins)</li><li>Cherries</li><li>Lemons</li><li>Limes</li><li>Grapefruit</li></ul><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":""}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":342979,"3":{"1":0},"4":{"1":2,"2":7775663},"9":1,"10":1,"11":4,"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":799805},"15":"Helvetica Neue","16":8,"19":0,"21":0}'><a class=aawp-product__image-link href=# title="Hepper 360 Cat Feeder, Stainless Steel, Anti-Chew..." rel="noopener sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64 data-load-type=image data-load-src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41irWeh4xGL._SL160_.jpg alt="Hepper 360 Cat Feeder, Stainless Steel, Anti-Chew..." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a class=aawp-product__title href=# title="Hepper 360 Cat Feeder, Stainless Steel, Anti-Chew..." rel="noopener sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link=external>Hepper 360 Cat Feeder, Stainless Steel, Anti-Chew...</a><ul><li>NO MESS - The 360° tray on this cat food and water bowl set has a raised design to catch and...</li><li>WHISKER FRIENDLY - Shallow and wide metal containers with flat bottoms ensure your kitty can enjoy...</li><li>CHEW-SAFE MATERIALS - Kittens and cats love chewing on silicone and soft rubber - but it's a choking...</li></ul></span></p><p>Knowing exactly what your feline companion can and cannot eat will help you become the best pet parent.
