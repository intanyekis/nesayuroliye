Per report, the woman “sustained minor injuries to her head and neck and was removed to an area hospital in stable condition.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The actor has maintained his innocence, as his legal team has revealed that they’ve obtained evidence that will prove Majors to be “completely innocent.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Jonathan Majors is completely innocent and is probably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows,” stated his criminal defense lawyer Priya Chaudhry. “We are quickly gathering and presenting evidence to the District Attorney with the expectation that all charges will be dropped imminently.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Chaudhry claims to have video footage from a vehicle where the alleged assault took place, as well as witness testimonies from the driver and onlookers. It is also reported that written statements from the victim will be used, as she recanted the allegations twice.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“All the evidence proves that Mr. Majors is entirely innocent and did not assault her whatsoever,” Majors’ lawyer added. “Unfortunately, this incident came about because this woman was having an emotional crisis, for which she was taken to a hospital yesterday. The NYPD is required to make an <a href=# id=auto-tag_arrest data-tag=arrest>arrest</a> in these situations, and this is the only reason Mr. Majors was arrested. We expect these charges to be dropped soon.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He has done nothing wrong,” Majors’ publicist <a href=#>stated to&nbsp;Variety</a>. “We look forward to clearing his name and clearing this up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2B8r63ToZinZZ2Wt7C%2B0macr6GUmruksYypqaiulWK2r7rOnJynm5Virq24xKCcnWWRqMCiwcutZGpqY2mEdYCXcHBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
