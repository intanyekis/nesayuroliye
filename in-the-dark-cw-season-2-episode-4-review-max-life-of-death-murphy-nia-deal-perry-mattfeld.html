When Max goes looking for it and finds it gone, his delay leads him to be arrested by Dean's partner, Officer Gene Clemens (Matt Murray).</p><p>The fourth episode of 'In the Dark' begins with Murphy visiting Max, but at this point, he wants nothing to do with her. He is undoubtedly mad about Nia's money missing, but we can't help but think that he's sour because of Murphy's relationship with Dean.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Max is in danger from one of Nia's men. He knows this, as does Murphy, and even Nia herself when her henchwoman, Sam, tells her that Max is alive. Darnell James (Keston John) is then called in because Nia wanted to confront him about getting too close to people, signifying she knew about his relationship with Dean's former partner, Jules Becker (Saycon Sengbloh).</p><p>Meanwhile, Dean asks Murphy to get Max to talk to him, promising her that he would transfer Max out of state prison and therefore out of Nia's reach. Unfortunately, when Max does comply and give Dean the address to Nia's stash house, Max said there was nothing he could do that could save Max and that only Nia herself could save Max.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/4126b585-67e3-4644-a561-7daddbc74f2a.png><p>Darnell is now on a warpath with Nia, knowing that she killed Jules despite knowing that he cared for her. While he pretends to work for her, he goes behind her back to give inside information to her competitor, Josiah.&nbsp;</p><p>When Darnell rolls up to Nia's stash house with Josiah's men, the police are already there. However, the police are late too. Murphy finally goes to Nia and buys Max's protection in exchange for telling what she knows -- and even worse than that, letting Nia hide her stash at Guiding Hope.</p><p>Meanwhile, for Felix and Jess, the episode was mainly about their significant others -- we see Jess having some fun times with Sterling and even confess that she has feelings for the other woman. Felix goes on a date with Chelsea, but is accosted by one of Nia's men for "stealing from her." Is Nia's henchwoman double-dipping into Nia's pot?&nbsp;</p><p>However, Feliz then builds up his courage by going to the shooting range and firing a few shots. He then seizes the day, as they say, and goes on to spend the night with Chelsea.</p><p>So what leads to Chelsea's brother being shot by Felix's gun in Chelsea's bar nine days in the future? Why are Felix and Murphy cleaning up the blood with the former also worrying about the "drugs"? Did Chelsea's brother discover Nia's stash at Guiding Hope, where he is doing a shoddy job as the receptionist?</p><p>We certainly have a lot of questions, as do a lot of the viewers. With the introduction of Josiah -- who seems someone even worse than Nia to get entangled with -- makes us think that Murphy and company's troubles are far from over. 'In the Dark' is quite a mature crime drama when it comes to The CW, and the network is pulling it off well.&nbsp;</p><p>'In the Dark' airs on Thursday nights at 9/8c on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooZ5iwamxjJ2Yq6NdmMRuv8SaqqimXWd6przIrKadnV1perOx1aKcsGWdlsVuuMifnGanlmKxpq3ToWSmraKltbp5zaKYZpyVlrluvMSrqbJlnZbBtbLEpZs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
