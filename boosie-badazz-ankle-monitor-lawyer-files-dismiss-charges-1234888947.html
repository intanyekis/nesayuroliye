Still, District Judge Cathy A. Bencivengo&nbsp;did approve of the removal of the ankle monitor.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Mr. Hatch’s ankle monitor condition was removed yesterday,” Blanco detailed in a statement to the outlet. “His case is still pending, but we have filed motions to dismiss, which we expect the Court to rule on shortly.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The charges stem from a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.vibe.com/news/entertainment/boosie-badazz-arrested-in-court-after-gun-charges-dismissed-1234765058/>June 2023 arrest </a>when Boosie was taken into custody after showing up to court for a gun case, which ended up being dismissed.

They showed no evidence of me being a flight risk or a danger to the community,” detailed the rapper on social media.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The prosecutor Mr. wheat looked at me singing ‘Wipe Me Down,’ wiped his shoulders and shook his head with a look of evil in his eyes. This is total misconduct from a prosecutor. He is racist and has evil intentions. Now they filed an appeal asking another judge to keep me in prison. I need the people of San Diego outside the court tomorrow to protest the injustice that is being done to me. I need ALL prayer warriors across the world to pray this southern district of California remove Mr. wheat and this prosecution off my case. Even my attorneys have never seen nothing like this in their career. Help Me Fight this Injustice and say a prayer for my freedom tomorrow.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8sL%2FInmSbmZSWx7t5wKeipZ1doryvtdOoqWakkazGpr6Mn6ClnaNisaq%2FzKKqrGWTna6zs8SsZGpqY2mFeYSYbW5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
