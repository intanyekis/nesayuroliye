At the MTV Video Music Awards last night (Sept. 12), Gaga snatched up the biggest trophy of the night for Video of the Year thanks to her maneater visuals for “Bad Romance.” During her emo acceptance speech, the popstress also let loose the title of her next album—Born This Way.&nbsp;</span><span id=more-53992></span></p><p><span>“I promised that if I won this, I would announce the name of my new album. It’s called Born This Way,” said Gaga, who then belted some lyrics from what we assume is the title track off the album.</span></p><p><span>Not much is known about the album, but Akon spilled some beans&nbsp;</span><a href=#><span>to VIBE</span></a><span> back in April: “All I’m doing at the end of the day is listening to the tracks Gaga has written and approving them for her album. She has producers that she works with outside of myself and they are coming up with some incredible records. But the beauty of it is she knows exactly what she wants.
