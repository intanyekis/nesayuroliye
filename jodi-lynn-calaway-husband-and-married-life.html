Jodi’s former partner is regarded as one of the best professional wrestlers of all time and a WWE legend.</strong></p><h2><span id=What8217s_Her_Estimated_Worth>What’s Her Estimated Worth?</span></h2><p>Given that her job is completely unknown, it is difficult to estimate her actual net worth. Her net worth, according to some sources, is between $500k and $1 million. Conversely, The Undertaker, her ex-husband, is thought to be worth $17 million.</p><h2><span id=Jodi_Lynn_Calaway_Who_Is_She_Her_Age_and_Bio>Jodi Lynn Calaway: Who Is She? Her Age and Bio</span></h2><p>As previously stated, Jodi is the ex-wife of WWE legend The Undertaker. There isn’t much information about her early years because she didn’t come into the public eye until after she married The Undertaker. She did, however, seem to have a good childhood, spending the majority of her early years with her mother and father.</p><p>Conversely, her well-known ex-husband, The Undertaker, was born Mark William Calaway in Housten, Texas, on March 24, 1965. As of 2022, he was 57 years old.
