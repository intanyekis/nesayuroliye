The <a href=#>Love & Hip-Hop</a> actress explained her thoughts on social media and threw shade at <a href=#>GloRilla</a> for making light of the situation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Per a report from a gossip account on X (<a href=#>formerly Twitter</a>), V was at Agenda lounge on Monday (April 29) and got hit from behind by multiple people before falling to the ground. Additional footage that surfaced online shows her being stomped while on the ground before security helped her up.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A nearby witness said that the attacker fled the scene and ran down the block. The alleged attacker was identified as a close friend of <a href=#>Star Brim</a> and is followed on social media by Cardi B, leading Akbar V to believe that this is no coincidence.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Akbar V was allegedly attacked in Agenda in New York last night.</p><p>Sources say Akbar V was spotted at the popular restaurant/lounge enjoying herself before stepping away from her entourage to speak to an unknown male.</p><p>As Akbar was engaging in conversation, she was allegedly hit… <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/sCKnlVr1Us</a></p>— Mílagro (@MobzWorld) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 30, 2024</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Aye tell her blood big [homie] she pu**y cause she [haul] a** and ran to the nearest exit and down the block,” Akbar V <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote on X</a>. “[That sh*t] ain’t respected yall [sent] the neighborhood crack head.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She shared a video of the alleged attacked and threw more insults her way. “And look at this grandma face looking slow looking a** [h**] here [bi**h lol,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a>. “Yall h**s are [ugly as f**k] this [why] i know it was Cardi who sent this lil dirty bum washed up [h**] *laughing emojis* didn’t even buy the [h**] some shoes [bi**h] had on sketchers Llh.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">GloRilla quoted the video of Akbar V getting stomped and asked, “Did da girl have on shell toes” in jest. V didn’t find that funny, and tweeted, “Bi**h ur head look like it bout to pop u slow looking a** lizard a** [h**].” <a href=#>Gloss Up</a> quoted the same video with multiple laughing emojis, and V had smoke for her, too. “U laughing i can’t wait to beat the black off u [h**],” she wrote with laughing emojis.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cardi B and Akbar V having tension isn’t new. In 2022, they traded subliminal shots over social media before things escalated into a direct feud that involved <a href=#>Offset</a>. The Bronx rapper and GloRilla celebrate the success of their “<a href=#>Tomorrow 2</a>” music video, but V was apprehensive about whether the claim that they got six million views in three days was true or not.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If @chartdata ain’t say it we ain’t believing the CAP,” she tweeted. Cardi countered and questioned if Chart Data had ever posted Akbar V at all. “I don’t really like the internet games,” she added. “My dms is open and also the streets!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">V followed up by sharing screenshots of texts with the “Up” rapper, which led to the Grammy winner doubling down on taking it off the internet and into real life. “If we said what we said on the phone why keep texting? These all these bi**hes want …INTERNET SHOWS..I’m done,” she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If we said what we said on the phone why keep texting?

Akbar V’s belief that Cardi ordered someone else to beat her up makes sense simply because of their tension, but may fall flat given the fact she offered her the fade directly in the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5ius7DIZplmmZOYwrSxw2aqnqyknruoedSpZJqjkpa%2FbsKMn6CgoKRifnN%2Fk3FubmlnZ3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
