The fight starts with just the two "dudes," and then later, Gosling shows up in a tank top to save the day. Now Gosling did comment on the moment, stating that he regretted it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, fans had nothing but praise for the actor stepping in.
