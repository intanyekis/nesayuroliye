He admitted to being nervous and scared as he attempted to back the dog down and defuse the dog’s altercation.’</p><p>He said, ‘Not once was I attempting to hurt this dog. All I was attempting was to get him back in the cage.’</p><p>He acknowledged that what he had done was a mistake and revealed that he had given one of the dogs away to a buddy.</p><p>Due to the recording, Emanuel was let off from the VH1 show Black Ink Crew on Thursday.</p><p>A network representative informed TMZ, ‘We have decided to terminate connections with Ceaser Emanuel from Black Ink Crew New York.

I CAN’T CHANGE THIS STORY!</p><p>According to Emanuel’s lawyer Walter Mosley,<strong> </strong>‘the video is old and was filmed at his apartment in Atlanta during COVID lockdown, thus there is no police participation in the matter.’</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvxJqqnqpdl7mir8pmoKejXZm8qHnAm6ysnV2rtqWxzmaeqKxdnbauecWiqZ6cXZu%2FsLmMrZ%2BeZaOdvLh7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
