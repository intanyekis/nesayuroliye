And I couldn’t be happier,” she exclusively tells Us Weekly of her role on Hit the Floor. “We have an entire staff of women writers, which is the other incredible thing about this show. It’s a room of women writing for women.”</p><p>The Vampire Diaries alum, 39, plays Lionel Davenport on the BET series. Lionel is an actress-turned-owner of the Inside Sports Network. Drama tends to follow her, whether it be in connection with the Los Angeles Devils basketball team or Devil Girls dance squad.</p><p>“Honestly the first time I got the script, I was like — I can just have so much fun with this all the time. I get to do and say whatever this character is thinking all day long. And I get to do it in a fabulous pair of heels. It’s very far removed from myself in my flats,” O’Keefe tells Us. “There is a lot of myself in every character that I play. But I wish I was more like Lionel to be honest. She doesn’t really seem to have a filter. She’s the ballsier version of me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jodi-Lyn-OKeefe-on-Hit-The-Floor.jpg><p>She adds: “She is not to be trifled with.”</p><p>O’Keefe has incorporated part of herself into Lionel, too — by wearing designs from her Q Jewelry line. “Every now and again I slip in a piece here and there,” she says. “Whenever our costume designer finds out that I do that sort of on the side, they ask to see what I have right now, and then they’ll pull a piece in.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>O’Keefe thinks she’s won “the lottery” with the series — especially because it’s the first time she’s had a short commute for work. Bonus: She’s so close that she sometimes drops by just to watch the dancers film.</p><p>“The dancers are so incredible,” she says. “I think I might be their biggest fan because even on days where I don’t have to shoot, if I know it’s a dance day, I end up going to the studio to see what they’re gonna do.”</p><p>Hit the Floor recently wrapped its fourth season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGonJliubq6jKiinp2WmnqqwNJmoKaon6fBorrTZquoZZietKm4yKCfrWWnpLqmuoycn5qqkZjBpr7SZqmin5ipeq%2B71mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
