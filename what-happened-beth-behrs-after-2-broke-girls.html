The show, co-created by Michael Patrick King, easily showcased Behrs’ comedic talent especially when she shared scenes with fellow co-lead Kat Dennings. They may have had <a href=#>some moments of controversy onscreen</a> too, (<a href=#>the series definitely had a reputation for 'being mean'</a>) but the duo was a hit to viewers, nonetheless. The show also went on to score 12 Emmy nods and one win throughout its run.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What The Cast Of 2 Broke Girls Has To Say About The Show</a></span>2 Broke Girls ended its run back in 2017. Since then, the cast has pretty much gone their separate ways. For instance, Dennings has gone on to pursue more work inside the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As for Behrs, the Pennsylvania native has been quite busy too. And much to fans' delight, the actress has also continued her pursuit of comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beth-behrs-recalls-being-broke-and-struggling-before-lsquo-2-broke-girls-rsquo>Beth Behrs Recalls Being Broke And Struggling Before ‘2 Broke Girls’</h2><p>Having graduated from UCLA’s Theater, Film, and Television program, Behrs was ready to take on Hollywood by storm. In the beginning, however, it didn’t seem like her career was gaining any traction. Behrs was only landing minor roles and brief guest TV appearances. Not to mention, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wasn’t earning much</a>.</p><p>“It was rough, I mean paycheck to paycheck,” the actress recalled. “My parents were so great and helped me with paying my cell phone and car bill and then scraping by to pay the rent. Me and my roommate shared a one bedroom for a while after school. It was crazy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To make a living, Behrs pursued several jobs, including being a restaurant hostess and a nanny. Fortunately, for the actress, her big break was just right around the corner.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>13 Tiny Details From Behind The Scenes Of 2 Broke Girls</a></span></p><p>Just like that, <a href=#>things just started looking up</a>. “I tested with (co-star Kat Dennings) on a Sunday morning, and then they didn’t tell us in the room that I had gotten the part, we had to wait a couple of hours and then the casting director called me to officially give me the news,” Behrs explained.</p><p>“So it was great, so wonderful to finally just hear because it had been such a long process, and I was the only one there with Kat, so I knew my odds were good, but they still weren’t telling us officially.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, 2 Broke Girls had to deal with an unexpected cancellation later on. Because of this, Behrs, Dennings, and the rest of the people involved with the show didn’t get to properly prepare for its ending. Since then, Behrs has moved on to another sitcom. This time, however, she’s no longer playing a single socialite. Instead, she’s a suburban mom.</p><h2 id=after-lsquo-2-broke-girls-rsquo-beth-behrs-has-gone-on-to-star-in-cbs-rsquo-lsquo-the-neighborhood-rsquo>After ‘2 Broke Girls’ Beth Behrs Has Gone On To Star In CBS’ ‘The Neighborhood’</h2><p>It seemed Behrs was determined to stick with comedy even after the untimely end of 2 Broke Girls. For the actress, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it plays a critical role in dealing with some of society’s greatest challenges</a>. “Laughter is one of the most universal things that brings people together, maybe music as well,” Behrs explained. “With laughter in particular, there's a release that happens and a lot of times laughter comes out of a release of tragedy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And so, the actress went on to star in the comedy The Neighborhood, although interestingly, Behrs wasn’t part of the cast at first. In fact, she and Max Greenfield were brought in after the show went through some title changes and several recastings. Initially, the part of school principal and mother Gemma was played by Dreama Walker in the pilot.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 2 Broke Girls: 20 Photos Of Max And Caroline We Can't Stop Looking At</a></span></p><p>Behrs may have felt guilty taking the part but in some ways, it also seemed like the actress was meant to play the role. For one thing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she could readily relate to it</a>.</p><p>“Gemma is the principal at a progressive school in Pasadena. She’s a strong, intelligent woman running a private school that her son attends. My mom was a teacher, and I went to the school where my mom worked,” Behrs revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Coming from a family of educators — my grandma, my aunts — in our current climate teachers are the most important people right now with our children. I’m excited to play one.”</p><p>At the same time, the actress also loved getting the opportunity to work with co-star Cedric the Entertainer. “Working with Cedric in front of a live audience, there's such an element of you don't know what he's going to throw at you,” Behrs remarked.</p><p>“As an actress who comes from the theater and loves that live feeling and electricity, I feel like working with Cedric has excited that theater-girl muscle in me. He's so funny and unpredictable when we're shooting in front of the audience.”</p><p>Meanwhile, The Neighborhood has already been renewed for a fifth season so fans can look forward to seeing more of Behrs as Gemma. At the same time, the actress stars in the upcoming buddy action-comedy Twin Blades. At the moment, the film is still in production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Close Are '2 Broke Girls' Stars Beth Behrs And Kat Dennings?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytbSMm5yhqqNirqfAxKtka2WSp7yssYygoKuko2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
