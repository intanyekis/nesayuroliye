The singer has been through many trials and tribulations, finding themselves frequently alone, but every time they return to the same road that takes them to their lover's door. The lyrics are full of emotion and longing, with the singer pleading for guidance and direction as they try to navigate their way back to the person they love.</p><br><p>The opening lines suggest a sense of familiarity with the road; the singer has been down this path before, but they always end up at the same destination - their lover's door. The imagery evokes a sense of journey and uncertainty, the winding road representing life's twists and turns, but also the willingness of the singer to endure whatever obstacles it takes to get back to their loved one. In the second stanza, the singer recounts a wild and windy night that washed away the rain but left them in a pool of tears, lamenting the distance between themselves and their lover, crying for a reunion. "Why leave me standing here" is an emotional plea and an expression of confusion, begging for guidance or a sign that will point them on their way.</p><br><p>The third stanza reveals that the singer has made many attempts to find their way back to their love, but something always brings them back to the winding road. The lyrics end with repetitions of the plea, each line becoming more urgent than the last. The emotions in the song are clear, with frustration and sadness giving way to desperation, and finally hope - the "yeah, yeah, yeahs" suggesting that the singer still believes they can find their way back to the person they love.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>The long and winding road</u><br>Life can be like a meandering path with many twists and turns.</p><br><p><u>That leads to your door</u><br>The path leads to a person we want to be near.</p><br><p><u>Will never disappear</u><br>The path to that person will always exist.</p><br><p><u>I've seen that road before</u><br>The journey has been taken multiple times.</p><br><p><u>It always leads me here</u><br>Every time, the path ends up at the same place - near the person we seek.</p><br><p><u>Lead me to your door</u><br>Please guide me to the person I long to see.</p><br><p><u>The wild and windy night</u><br>The turbulent and chaotic times that life can bring.</p><br><p><u>That the rain washed away</u><br>The storm cleared away some of the troubles.</p><br><p><u>Has left a pool of tears</u><br>Sadness and pain were left behind.</p><br><p><u>Crying for the day</u><br>Longing for a better tomorrow.</p><br><p><u>Why leave me standing here?</u><br>Wondering why one is being left alone to suffer.</p><br><p><u>Let me know the way</u><br>Asking for guidance out of a difficult situation.</p><br><p><u>Many times I've been alone</u><br>Having felt isolation before.</p><br><p><u>And many times I've cried</u><br>Numerous instances of emotional pain.</p><br><p><u>Anyway, you'll never know</u><br>The person we long for will never understand our innermost thoughts and feelings.</p><br><p><u>The many ways I've tried</u><br>The many attempts to connect with the person we miss.</p><br><p><u>And still they lead me back</u><br>Despite efforts to move on, the road always leads back to that one person.</p><br><p><u>You left me standing here</u><br>The person we miss may have abandoned or rejected us.</p><br><p><u>Don't leave me waiting here</u><br>A plea for the person not to hurt us further.</p><br><p><u>Don't keep me waiting here</u><br>A reiteration of the need not to be left alone.</p><br><p><u>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</u><br>A repetition that emphasizes the emotional plea being made.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: John Lennon, Paul McCartney</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIyYmqyDscCto56rX4m1pqurqKWgl5GjsaCjyKeboqaXlJ%2BwrcM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
