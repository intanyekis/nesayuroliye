As a child, he was fascinated by the Rubik’s Cube and realized that he could find strategies to solve it faster by connecting to the internet via his parent’s computer. This eventually led him to discover Twitter and YouTube when he was 11 years old.</li><li>He started by uploading videos including dark-comedy sketches on both these platforms. He later joined the Vine platform when he was 15 and used to post videos daily.</li><li>Rich Brian also learned English by watching YouTube videos of rappers such as <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Childish Gambino</a>, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>2 Chainz</a>, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Macklemore</a>, and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Tyler, the Creator</a>. The videos also introduced him to the hip-hop musical genre and he wrote his first rap song in 2014. The song was recorded on an iPhone microphone over an <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>MF DOOM</a> produced instrumental.</li><li>Initially, he was interested in cinematography and had wished to attend a film school after moving to Los Angeles. However, he gave up the pursuit after his music career took off.</li><li>On January 1, 2018, he changed his stage name from Rich Chigga to Brian and eventually to Rich Brian because he would often face criticism for the name Rich Chigga which was perceived as having racial overtones and insulting to both Black and Chinese people.</li><p>Featured Image by Rich Brian / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqugnKBdl7%2Bqrc1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
