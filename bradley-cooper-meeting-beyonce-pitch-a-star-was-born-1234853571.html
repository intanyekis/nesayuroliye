According to Cooper, the studio executive of the film wanted the “Break My Soul” songstress for “under $25 million.” Cooper shared that during that “crazy” meeting with Bey for the leading role of Ally, he also witnessed <a href=# id=auto-tag_jay-z data-tag=jay-z>JAY-Z</a> casually watching a beloved court show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I went to Beyoncé’s house, and JAY-Z was watching&nbsp;Judge Judy, I still remember,” he shared with the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234811290>SAG-AFTRA Foundation</a> in an interview. “I’m not kidding. And I was freaking [out]. I remember I had this weird cough when I was pitching it to her. It was crazy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He added, “She was incredible and so was [JAY-Z], and we developed it for like a year together. I mean, she’s one of the greatest people of all time. Then that fell through.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Maestro star revealed that&nbsp;Adele&nbsp;was also considered for the role of the aspiring singer, but she “only texted him back once and was busy.” Cooper then found his co-star, Gaga, after witnessing her vocal ability during a benefit concert performance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It just blew the doors off of the whole place, and it was in that moment where it was like, ‘That’s it. What was I even thinking?’ And then I asked to meet her,” he continued. Rightfully so, the film went on to&nbsp;earn eight nominations at the 91st Academy Awards, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Best Original Song</a>&nbsp;for “Shallow” — a&nbsp;duet with Cooper who plays Jackson “Jack” Maine and Gaga.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For Beyoncé, she hasn’t taken on a leading role since the 2009&nbsp;Steve Shill-directed film Obsessed, where she played <a href=# data-type=post data-id=677229>wife to Idris Elba</a>. However, the business woman has still <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234824066>broken the box office</a> wide open with her recent concert-film for Renaissance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MCDOBSE_EC017.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The film documented the&nbsp;<a href=#>production of Bey’s&nbsp;Renaissance&nbsp;tour</a>, which started three years ago.

It followed behind&nbsp;Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour&nbsp;film, which set a record for making quarter of a billion dollars worldwide; Justin Bieber’s&nbsp;Never Say Never&nbsp;($73 million),&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>’s&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is It</a>&nbsp;($72 million), and then Miley Cyrus’&nbsp;Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds&nbsp;($65 million) rounding out the top five.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Take a look at what Bradley Cooper had to say about meeting Beyoncé and JAY-Z above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e%2ForDLnrBmm5%2Bkvaa%2BjKacnqyZo7RursSypqeblWK9qsDCoWSaZaOprrN51pqqZpqfp7tufZFsa3FtY2qEcns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
