Yesterday she lost her brother in a motorcycle accident down in Georgia. Words can’t describe how heartbreaking this loss is.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Logan Ries</a>, I had the privilege of watching you grow up thanks to your sister. You were always one of the sweetest guys ever. So much that your sister and I use to plot when we were younger, how we were going to get you to marry my sister so we could all be one family. Thanks for tagging along so many times with your sister and I. Haunted houses, bonfires, or just simply hanging out at your moms house, you were truly one of a kind and will be so incredibly missed.</p><p>Logan enjoyed a variety of activities, such as riding his motorcycle, fishing, hunting, playing football, listening to country music, and attending truck pulls. He lived his life to the fullest and made every moment count. Although his loss is deeply felt by those who knew him, Logan’s impact on their lives will always be remembered with fondness and appreciation.</p><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Austin Wenger Accident: Know Everything About him, Cause of death</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gofundme_for_Logan_Ries></span>Gofundme for Logan Ries<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the wake of Logan Ries’ tragic passing, his best friend and brother, Blake Johnson, has launched a <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>fundraising campaign</a></strong> to support Logan’s family during this difficult time.

Losing you is such a tragedy, a kind of pain that will never be forgotten. Your kind heart, electric energy, and high spirit will be missed so deeply. You were such a bright light that shined into so many people’s lives, you always lifted others up and cared for them so much. Knowing and loving you, was truly a gift that I will forever be thankful for. I already miss you so much, and life will not be the same without you. You are so loved by many, and we are all hurting in your absence. We will celebrate your beautiful life, and forever wish we had more time with you. You are such a beautiful soul, may you rest in peace.
