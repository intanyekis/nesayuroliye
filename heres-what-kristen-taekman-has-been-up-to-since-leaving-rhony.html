Despite leaving the show, Kirsten has not only remained close to a handful of 'wives, but she's also continued her eff0rts in business.</p><p>With six years having passed, Bravo viewers are curious as to what the former RHONY star has been up to, and after a little diggin', we're covering just that!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Ever Happened To ‘RHONY’ Star, Cindy Barshop?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-has-kristen-been-up-to>What Has Kristen Been Up To?</h2><p>Kristen Taekman made quite a splash when she joined the cast of the Real Housewives Of New York City back in its sixth season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taekman joined the ranks of Heather Thomson, Ramona Singer, Luann de Lesseps, and Carole Radziwill, however, she certainly did not get along with all of them. The Pop Of Color nail polish designer and model clashes heavily with Singer during her first go at the series.</p><p>A paddle splash led to a wine glass to the face, ultimately starting Kristen's feud with Ramona. This carried over onto season 7, however, Taekman and returning cast member, Bethenny Frankel, took the lead when it came to their feud.</p><p>This marked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristen's final season on the show</a>, leaving many to wonder what she has been up to since. Well, following her release of Pop Of Color, which Bethenny wasn't a fan of, Kristen went from modeling and nail art, to focusing on her fashion blog, Last Night's Look.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Real Reason Bethenny Frankel Really Left ‘RHONY’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she doesn't remain too close with any of her former RHONY co-stars, Kristen is very close to former RHOBH star, Brandi Glanville.

"We both look forward to moving past this and getting on with our lives."</p><p>Although it came as a shock, Kristen assured fans that she and Josh were not splitting up.
