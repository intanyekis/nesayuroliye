Cameron starts to hear strange sounds in the night coming from the basement’s locked door shortly after moving into her new house. Later, she finds out what was really behind that door: chained-up victims of her aunt’s scams to make money by cashing their benefits checks. Cameron’s mother desperately seeks her whereabouts without much assistance from social services or the government before she has demoted down into the basement herself and stayed there for the next ten years. When Cameron discovers she is confined to a closet.</p><h2 id=who_is_mia_smith_in_girl_in_the_closet class=smooth-goto>Who is Mia Smith in Girl in The Closet</h2><p>Mia is Patricia’s sister. She is an unwelcome presence in her life. Mia helped raise Trish, and it’s indicated that something strange happened when they were younger. Mia also served time in prison for kidnapping a guy and beating him to death in her closet. Even though Mia shows up at Cameron’s 10th birthday party bearing gifts and money for Cameron and telling Trish how much she’s changed, Trish shoos Mia away. These days, Mia is living large with her husband, Chris, and her grown daughter.</p><h2 id=who_plays_mia_smith_in_girl_in_the_closet class=smooth-goto>Who Plays Mia Smith in Girl in The Closet?</h2><p>Tami Roman plays the character of Mia Smith in Girl in the Closet. Tami Roman is a television personality, businesswoman, model, and actress. Tami first became famous in The Real World: Los Angeles in 1993. After giving cameo appearances and featuring in supporting roles in several TV shows and movies in the 1990s and 2000s, Tami became one of the breakout stars of VH1’s Basketball Wives. During her time on The Real World: Los Angeles, Tami created her own R&B girl group quartet called Reality.</p><p><a class=ahreftag-styles href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/TamiRoman/status/1636168777443299329</a></p><h2 id=girl_in_the_closet_stream_it_or_skip_it class=smooth-goto>Girl in The Closet Stream it or Skip it?</h2><p>Girl in the Closet on Lifetime depicts the tale of a lady who kidnaps her sister’s child and imprisons her for more than ten years. &nbsp;A very poorly run Department of Child Services places Cameron in Mia’s foster care after Trish experiences an aneurysm and becomes unconscious. As soon as Cameron is brought to Mia’s house, she is locked in a basement where she finds three other people, including Nancy, Mia’s housekeeper, and Harland and Joanne, a couple who are only there to have children so Mia can claim them as dependents and get welfare checks. By the time Cameron arrives, it appears that Mia has been operating this scam for some time. Cameron is simply another check that Mia can now cash.</p><p>Tami Roman from Basketball Wives and Remy Ma from Love & Hip Hop star in the made-for-TV movie together as the sisters in the true-life event-based drama. As a crucial narrative development, it is revealed that the DCS caseworkers never even checked her background. When they check on Mia after Trish asks them where Cameron is (somehow a whole year after Cameron vanished), she gives them the runaround and subsequently flees to Nashville with Cameron and the rest of her prisoners.</p><h2 id=how_to_watch_lifetime_girl_in_the_closet class=smooth-goto>How to Watch Lifetime Girl in The Closet?</h2><p>You can catch up with Girl in the Closet on Philo.
