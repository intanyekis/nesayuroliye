He added that Lanez is currently “evaluating ALL of his options.”</p><p></p><p>“It has been brought to my attention that a blogger has claimed that Tory Lanez is not a priority because I’m allegedly in Italy,” Baez began. “For the record, I travel to Italy 2 to 4 times a year. I have both business interests as well as clients who have business in Italy. It is a beautiful country and a privilege to visit.</p><p>“This blogger has had a clear bias against Tory and has attacked everyone associated with him as well as made numerous inaccurate assumptions. In fairness to her, she has no legal training and has never worked in the court system, so her opinions have little to no merit whatsoever.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “Finally to all of Tory’s fans. I can report that because of his motion for a new trial covered many of the issues that will be appealed. We are way ahead of schedule. The court reporter has not completed all of the transcripts and until that happens he must wait to file the appeal.</p><p>“As for other motions Tory is evaluating ALL of his options. Thank you all, he appreciates your support.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Cuniff responded to Baez’s scathing rebuttal, writing on X: “Ignoring the unprofessional comments, the takeaway from Jose Baez’s Instagram stories today is he’s no longer sure if he’ll file a motion for bail pending Lanez’s appeal: ‘As for other motions, Tory is evaluating ALL of his options.'”</p><p>She also posted a screenshot on Instagram of an email exchange with Baez, who commended Cuniff and said he would “always be respectful towards” her.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ignoring the unprofessional comments, the takeaway from Jose Baez's Instagram stories today is he's no longer sure if he'll file a motion for bail pending Lanez's appeal: "As for other motions, Tory is evaluating ALL of his options."</p><p>I'll discuss live: <a href=#>https://t.co/IuWFYa0veT</a></p><p>— Meghann Cuniff (@meghanncuniff) <a href=#>August 26, 2023</a></p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Tory Lanez is currently being held away from the general population</a> in the “administrative segregation unit” in Los Angeles, which is for those who cannot be safely housed with other inmates.
