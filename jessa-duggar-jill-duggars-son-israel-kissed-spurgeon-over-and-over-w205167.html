Luckily, the boys finally got a chance to meet for the first time when Jessa and Ben brought their little one for a recent visit, and the lads got along swimmingly.</span></p><p><span>Using Israel’s nickname for Spurgeon, Jill says of the kids’ time together, “Israel is a little bigger than his Spurgie Cousin, so we had to keep an eye on him and make sure he didn’t smother him with kisses or smoosh him trying to climb in his car seat to play.”</span></p><p>The first-time mom points out that the visit made quite an impression on Israel: “After meeting his Spurgie Cousin and hearing the little baby squeaks he makes, Israel has started making the same noises anytime we talk with Spurgie Cousin, or he hears us talking about babies or sees babies when we’re out and about.”</p><p><span>Jessa agrees that the pair’s introduction was “absolutely adorable!”</span></p><p>“They had seen pictures of each other and had ‘met’ via video chat, so Izzy knew who Spurgie Cousin was,” the<i> Jill & Jessa: Counting On </i>star says. “When [Izzy] saw him, he got so excited, gave him a hug and kissed him over and over! It was so cute!”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=1000 height=757 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jessa also tells<i> Us </i>about her plans to raise Spurgeon <a href=#>“differently” from her own upbringing</a>, and she gives an update on where she and Ben are <a href=#>in their adoption process</a>.
