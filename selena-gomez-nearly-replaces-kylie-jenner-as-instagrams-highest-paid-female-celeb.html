With 338 million followers, she makes approximately $1.8 million per sponsored post. Recently, the mother-of-two made big bucks by advertising brands like Alo Yoga and Glow energy drink in posts made to her feed.</p><p>But Selena Gomez is close to catching up. With 320 million followers, the Disney Channel alum reportedly makes $1.7 million per posts. What’s even more promising is that Selena’s social following has been growing rapidly this year, while Kylie’s has taken a hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March, it was reported that <a href=#>Kylie lost millions of followers</a> after she made a TikTok with Hailey Bieber that appeared to make fun of Selena’s eyebrows after a laminating mishap Though Kylie and Hailey’s followings took a dip after the ill-received TikTok, Selena saw a boost in her follower count.</p><p>If Selena’s numbers continue to grow, while Kylie’s stays the same (or plummet again), Selena could surpass Kylie as the most followed and most well-paid female celebrity on Instagram.</p><p>It also works in Selena’s favor that her makeup company Rare Beauty has been skyrocketing, which is helping her billionaire status.</p><p><a href=#>As per Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Selena’s current net worth is $800 million.

This is my true passion in life."</p><p>"People keep asking me what I want for my birthday, and I tell everyone the same thing please do not get me anything but if you want to do something for my birthday, please donate to the Rare Impact Fund,” she continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena launched Rare Beauty in 2020, and it’s already one of the biggest beauty brands available.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Erika Jayne Wins Appeal, But Won’t Get Infamous Diamond Earrings Back (Yet)</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>HopperHQ</a>, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAprjEp5hmn5%2Bisrt5zZ6Yq6SpYr%2BmvMuamp6rXaDGrbXEZqGepp6av26t0magp6uklrSzrcysZKGhl52ytMCMqZiinF2bsq6ty55knJ2cmq9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
