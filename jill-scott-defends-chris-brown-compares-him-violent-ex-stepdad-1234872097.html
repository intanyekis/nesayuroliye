How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234801591>Act</a> and Rap… like THAT?,” Scott tweeted, continuing, “Beyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional. There’s nothing to debate.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fans <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234849765>quickly reacted</a> to the singer’s tweet, mentioning that <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234646047>the women who’ve been abused </a>by Brown would view him as anything but exceptional. However, Scott disagreed, referencing her mother’s ex-husband, whom she felt was “a mean, violent human” and a talented blue collar worker.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“My Mother’s ex husband was a mean, violent human AND he could lay foundation better than anyone in my city. What he did with cement was awe inspiring. We got away. He got a raise and praise for his ability. God dealt with the rest,” said the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=682562>mother of one</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-22-at-9.45.35 AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In regards to her former stepfather, she <a rel=nofollow href=#>explained</a>, “It means that even he had something to offer. He was sick/hurt and did cruel things. I forgave him because of his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234813516>trauma</a>. Did I forget? Never. So I try my best to choose better. I’ve failed a few times but not in that abusive area.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-22-at-9.48.00 AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She credited her <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234781459>compassion</a> to “years of prayer, therapy, self reflection, & making every effort to keep my feet on the ground.” The “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234713707>Golden</a>” singer <a rel=nofollow href=#>empathized</a> with people who “go through s**t and do terrible s**t.” Later <a rel=nofollow href=#>adding</a>, “No man or woman is above or below. We’re all human beings; Flawed & figuring it out.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Scott also condemned those who don’t forgive. “And I caution those who <a href=# data-type=post data-id=673553>refuse to forgive </a>because they will undoubtedly need forgiveness at some point in their lives. We’re all flawed and need help. Power to people who move past violence. The past is a terrible reminder AND the future is ours,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow>expressed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-22-at-9.46.24 AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Scott doubled-down on her sentiments though, adding, “I’m not here to fight anymore else’s battles. If/since women hear the stories, they should avoid that street. Running backwards in moving traffic makes zero sense. Therapy for every damn body.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, after sparking a <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234772051>heated debate</a> with many considering her to be “out of touch,” Scott ended the topic of discussion with this: “Walked away, came back, googled, read tweets, listened to friends & considered the state of us as a whole. Some, lead with love (YOU gave me perspectives to consider & directive. THANK YOU ). Some a you ONLY want the highs of war. You may have your war.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Walked away, came back, googled, read tweets, listened to friends & considered the state of us as a whole.

Scott claimed that she was unaware of<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234845778> the diss</a> when she tweeted her sentiments, but agreed that Brown “<a rel=nofollow href=#>went too low</a>.” She has also been very tapped into the battle of <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234869952>Drake against the world</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dayuuuuummm!!!!! <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Drake</a></p><p>I wish I could post this at the same damn time. <a href=# rel=nofollow>#I</a>’mhereforthebars</p>— ⭐Jill Scott⭐ (@missjillscott) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 15, 2024</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My WORD!!! <a href=# rel=nofollow>@kendricklamar</a> SMH?
