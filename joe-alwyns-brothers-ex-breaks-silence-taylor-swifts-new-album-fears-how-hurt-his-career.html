She expressed excitement over Tay’s album, admitting she’s counting down the days until its release, suggesting not all of the Alwyn family is on bad terms with the pop star after her and Joe’s split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-alwyn-family-may-not-be-upset-with-taylor>The Alwyn Family May Not Be Upset With Taylor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_what-other-stars-have-said-about-taylor-swift-good-and-bad-_bk_a1.jpg><p>Cartelli, 20, sparked intrigue among social media users after sharing a TikTok video on Thursday, April 11, where she was seen eating with the caption, "Deeply upset with myself for lurking and thinking that I wouldn't hurt my own feelings."</p><p>Following up with another video, Cartelli captioned it, "Anyway, so excited for April 19," a clear reference to the release date for Taylor’s album.</p><p>Interestingly, both videos featured her in the same outfit, eating from the same bowl, and positioned at the same angle. While the second clip has been deleted from her account, it was subsequently reposted elsewhere, including X (formerly known as Twitter) causing speculation and curiosity among her followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Brynn’s videos were vague and perhaps meant to stir up speculation as to their meaning, some social media users speculate that she has a side of the story to share regarding Taylor and Joe’s break-up.

No one is safe,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source previously told Life & Style</a>. “Joe should be worried about what she reveals.”</p><p>During their relationship, it was speculated that Alwyn wasn’t as comfortable with the spotlight as Swift, given that they kept their romance largely private, though she’d been more open about her relationships in the past (as well as the present with Kelce). Taylor also has a reputation about opening up about her love life in her songs, so fans are confident she’ll do the same on her upcoming record.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t065511-258.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>An Inside Look At Taylor Swift's Relationship With Her Parents</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite the many health struggles her parents have faced, Andrea and Scott Swift always prioritized Taylor's dreams and passion for music.</span><p>Taylor confirmed new music was on the way in February at the Grammys, despite being in the middle of her Eras world tour.

Interestingly, her album has gotten some <a href=#>backlash over how expensive it is to own</a> all versions with all bonus tracks, though Swift hasn’t directly commented on the controversy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dlrm4xc2sZJuqn6m1pr7SZpyxZZKnsqK30maqoqSVo7CmedOasKWnomLAuLXFrapmppWseqK4wa6kZp6Vlr%2B0eceormagpafBbrTIrGScmaKasrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
