If you rip the shelf to make it narrower, make sure the <b>off-cut</b> is from the back of the shelf so you can preserve the veneered edge. If you prefer, you can purchase edge beading and apply it to all the edges after you’re finished cutting.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-wide-are-standard-bookshelves></span>How wide are standard bookshelves?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The standard width is <b>31 inches</b>. The depth will range from 12 to 13 inches. However, it’s not hard to find a two-shelf bookcase as tall as 36 inches. Two-shelf bookcases are the right size for small book collections, or to serve as bookcases dedicated to encyclopedias and large photographic books.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-ikea-billy-bookcases-any-good></span>Are Ikea Billy bookcases any good?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The original Billy bookcase ranks at an <b>overall 4.6/5 stars</b> on the Ikea website under their customer reviews section, making it a generally liked product. In the specific product review breakdown, the Billy bookcase received the following ratings: Value for Money: 4.7/5. Product Quality: 4.5/5.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-billy-bookcase-shelves-sag></span>Do Billy bookcase shelves sag?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Why do Billy Bookcase Shelves Sag? Billy bookcases sag <b>because they are made out of particle-board</b>. This material, while cheap, is not as durable as pure wood or other shelf materials.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-deep-is-a-billy-bookcase></span>How deep is a Billy bookcase?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>IKEA Billy Bookcases come in height variations from tall at 93.25” (237 cm) to short at 41.75” (106 cm). Widths range from wide designs at 31.5” (80 cm) to thin designs at 15.75” (40 cm). All bookcases have a depth of <b>11” (28 cm)</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-space-do-you-need-between-bookshelves></span>How much space do you need between bookshelves?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Most open or floating shelves in the living room, kitchen, or bedroom have a distance of 8 to 12 inches between each. However, a gap of <b>7 to 15 inches</b> between shelves is permissible. For bookcases, shelves are usually 8 to 12 inches from one another.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-make-my-billy-bookcase-more-sturdy></span>How do I make my Billy bookcase more sturdy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To correct and strengthen your BILLY, all you need is a few more nails (consider using double the nails as suggested in the original instructions) and <b>some wood glue</b>. Place the flimsy backing piece back on your bookcase as directed, but use more nails hammered more closely together.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-you-need-to-fix-billy-bookcase-to-wall></span>Do you need to fix Billy bookcase to wall?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Bookcases do not need to be fixed to the wall unless circumstances call for it due to safety reasons</b>. It is recommended that you fix your bookcase to a wall if you have pets or small children, or if you live in areas that are prone to earthquakes.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-leave-the-back-off-a-billy-bookcase></span>Can you leave the back off a Billy bookcase?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The downside of <b>not using backing</b> is it makes the bookcases much less stable, but we are adding plenty of trim and wood facing so these are still solid as a rock. I wouldn’t recommend using an IKEA billy bookcase without the back unless you are planning to reinforce the bookcase somehow.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-make-billy-bookcases-look-expensive></span>How do you make Billy bookcases look expensive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-put-doors-on-a-billy-bookcase></span>Can you put doors on a Billy bookcase?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>An Ikea Billy bookcase can be <b>used with or without wooden or glass fronted doors</b>, thanks to the pre-drilled holes for the adjustable shelving. … This task will be a lot easier and safer if you have someone to help you hold the doors steady while attaching them to the bookcase.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-ikea-billy-bookcase-fit-in-car></span>Will Ikea Billy bookcase fit in car?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Thanks for the info! <b>Yes</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-put-wallpaper-on-billy-bookcase></span>Can you put wallpaper on Billy bookcase?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Brightening up a boring Billy Bookcase – IKEA Hackers<p>It is very box like and needed a bit of livening up so I applied fabric to the backing panel and it looks fantastic.

Since Billy is covered in a thin laminate veneer and not wood, the usual sanding method to prep for paint will not work.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-join-billy-bookcases-together></span>How do you join Billy bookcases together?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-billy-bookcase-have-a-back></span>Does Billy bookcase have a back?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Ikea debuted its classic and clean-lined Billy bookcases in October of 1979, and 30 years later, still produce one every 15 minutes. Unfortunately, Billy’s sleek looks and slender price tag are not matched in durability. … Replacing the <b>back</b> of a Billy bookcase is a lot easier than assembling it in the first place.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-paint-a-bookcase></span>Can you paint a bookcase?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You can use <b>paint to dress up</b> a solid wood or particle board shelf to make it more modern or playful. Wood absorbs paint, so an already painted bookshelf requires some preparation before you can grab the brush and get started. … Sand the entire bookcase, including the shelves, lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-wallpaper-ikea-furniture></span>Can I wallpaper IKEA furniture?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Can you put wallpaper on IKEA furniture? <b>Yes, you can use wallpaper on IKEA furniture</b>. I’ve used peel and stick wallpaper on the back of a Billy bookcase with success. IKEA furniture is practically made to be hacked with paint and wallpaper!<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=has-ikea-discontinued-billy></span>Has IKEA discontinued BILLY?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The BILLY bookcase is a legend. One of IKEA’s signature products, BILLY models <b>remain in the company’s catalog year after year</b>, and it even has its own entry on Wikipedia.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-stack-2-billy-bookcases></span>Can you stack 2 BILLY bookcases?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>BILLY bookcases are built with a <b>stackable design</b> that allows you to attach new units whenever you need additional storage, just decide on what height suits your space best. Every model in the BILLY series also features adjustable shelves so you can fit anything from books to trophies, and everything in between.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-books-does-a-billy-bookcase-hold></span>How many books does a BILLY bookcase hold?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The ubiquitous IKEA Billy bookcase, for example, runs almost 30″ wide and has <b>6 shelves</b>. That means it offers just under 180″ of shelf. If you need 600 inches of shelf, you’ll need 3.33 bookshelves (600 divided by 180).<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlp56xpnnIrGSaZZKeua3FjJumqKOTlsCmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
