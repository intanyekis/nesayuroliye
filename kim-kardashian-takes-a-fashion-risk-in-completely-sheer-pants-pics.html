The look included an off-white jacket, which the Skims CEO paired with a snowy tube top. Kardashian continued the “naked” theme with her pants, opting for wide-leg trousers that nearly exposed her bum.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The California native finalized the outfit with a pair of pointed-toe pumps. She accessorized with a simple pendant necklace and diamond stud earrings. For glam, Kardashian rocked rosy makeup, which included pink eyeshadow, blush and a glossy lip.
