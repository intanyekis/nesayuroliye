While things on set were not always the most comfortable for the stars of the films, the money that they earned for their participation in the franchise literally financially set them for life.</p><p>In the years since, there have been some breakout stars from the original cast of the films. Most notably, Kristen Stewart, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Princess Diana in 'Spencer', Anna Kendrick, who has not only appeared in a couple dozen films since 'Twilight', but has produced and directed films as well, and Robert Pattinson, who has taken on the role of Batman in 'The Batman' franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite different levels of fame, the stars of 'Twilight' walked away from the series as millionaires, which allowed them to take roles they wanted to after their time with 'Twilight' came to an end, versus being in the position of having to take any roles that came their way because they were struggling actors. And with the number of projects everyone has coming out in the next couple of years, these stars are not going anywhere anytime soon.</p><h2 id=cam-gigandet-mdash-net-worth-4-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Cam Gigandet — Net Worth $4 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52937541-1.jpg><p>Kicking the list off at spot number 10 is Cam Gigandet who, according to Celebrity Net Worth, has an estimated net worth of $4 million.</p><p>Cam played James Witherdale in the first movie of the saga but he is also known for his roles in Never Back Down (2008), Pandorum (2009), Burlesque (2010), and Easy A (2010), as well as the teen drama The O.C.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There will be quite a bit seen of Cam seen in the next couple of years.
