After thousands of plaintiffs and defendants processed through her courtroom and countless episodes airing over the course of her career, Sheindlin said goodbye to Judge Judy and is preparing to usher in her new and improved courtroom program, called Judy Justice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are all geared up for the November 1st premiere date, which is quickly rounding the bend. Deadline reports that while some aspects of this show will remain consistently aligned with the original program, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this spinoff promises to be special and unique in many ways.</a>..</p><h2 id=it-39-s-a-family-affair><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>It's A Family Affair</span></h2><p>Judy Sheindlin is worth a staggering $440 million, and she's smart enough to keep things in the family. Ensuring that her loved ones also get their shot at achieving financial success, she has cast her granddaughter, Sarah Rose in the new spinoff show. Judy was excited to report that Sarah would be joining the show as a law clerk which presides over hearings, telling the press, "I’ve known Sarah, our law clerk, since she was born. She will be a third-generation female lawyer in our family. She’s smart, sassy, and opinionated. Who knows where she gets those traits?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Judge Judy Is Worth $420 Million: How She Amassed Her Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=the-integrity-of-the-show-remains-intact><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Integrity Of The Show Remains Intact</span></h2><p>Sometimes, when a spinoff show is created, fans are displeased by the changes that are made. In this situation, the integrity of the show is being kept intact, allowing Judy Justice to continue to accurately portray the original role that Judy Sheindlin took on for the Judge Judy show. Promising not to stray too far from the elements that made her first show a huge success, Sheindlin tells the Hollywood Reporter, “Look, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I do what I do, so within the confines of me doing what I do,</a> we’ll be changing some of the things around me. But I’m not becoming a ballet dancer.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=unlike-other-new-shows-this-won-39-t-have-a-learning-curve><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Unlike Other New Shows, This Won't Have A Learning Curve</span></h2><p>Ironing out the bugs is just one of the many obstacles facing new programming, and often times, the struggle is visible to the viewers. Judy Justice won't require any de-bugging, and by all accounts, it seems there will be no learning curve at all. The transition into this new show promises to be a smooth and easy one, as Sheindlin keeps longtime executive producer and director Randy Douthit as well as the show's co-executive producer Amy Freisleben on her team.</p><p>This team has been working together seamlessly for 25 years on the set of Judge Judy and are expected to skipping over the usual learning curves that would otherwise exist with the assembly of a brand new team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>The Truth About Judge Judy’s Son, Adam Levy</a></span></p><h2 id=this-show-will-be-a-daily-addiction><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>This Show Will Be A Daily Addiction</span></h2><p>Excited fans are delighted to hear that they won't have to wait long between the airing of new episodes of Judy Justice. The production team has committed to airing a hot, new episode each and every weekday, meaning fans that want to get their daily fix of courtroom drama, will be highly entertained 5 days a week. Opting to dive right in to an aggressive taping and editing schedule, these new episodes will reach viewers at a fast and furious pace, promising to quickly become a daily addiction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=audiences-can-tune-in-anytime><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Audiences Can Tune In Anytime</span></h2><p>The interesting twist behind Judy Justice is the fact that audiences will have the option of streaming episodes at any time.

Audiences that have fond, nostalgic memories of their time watching Judge Judy can rely on the same platform and the familiar foundational elements of this new show. Viewers that are just joining in or are part of a different age bracket that perhaps did not grow up with Judge Judy, are now able to view the program by streaming it and exploring a new addiction. By merging the same, tested and proven formula with modern-day streaming access, fans are getting the very best of both worlds.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To R.

Judge Judy herself has moved on in age and is now being pushed out of her comfort zone when it comes to being relatable to her audience. She is covering issues that represent those that unfold in modern, current-day society, inclusive of social media disputes and details and language that embrace the social culture of today. Issues such as the pandemic, social media usage, technology, and modern-day slang references will all rise to the surface. At one point, the court hears a comparison to a "Karen," and Judy Sheindlin is forced to stay on her toes, and on top of current trends.</p><h2 id=39-judy-justice-39-is-already-riddled-with-juicy-controversy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>'Judy Justice' Is Already Riddled With Juicy Controversy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's certainly nothing like good, old-fashioned real-life drama to keep people tuned in to a brand-new show, and Judy Justice promises to deliver. People reports that despite the fact that it hasn't even aired yet,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the program is already riddled with controversy</a>. Longtime fans of the show will recall the fact that Petri Hawkins-Byrd played the steady role of the bailiff for Judge Judy, yet shockingly, he was not asked to bring his talents into the new show. He has come forward to indicate that he felt snubbed and is deeply offended that he was not included in Judy Justice.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Zayn Malik Pleads Guilty to Harassing Yolanda Hadid</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmoa6cl5p6q8HDsqpmppWserS0zrBko62UrnqrwdKtoJydXay2rbiMm5xmq6CasKqty2ahrpypYsCpscinm6WhnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
