It spanned multiple timelines, a couple of rewrites, and several pivotal events that set up Phase 4's coming battles. But one thing that the Russo Brothers conveniently left out of their Phase 3 climax was Cap's last mission.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To quickly recap, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) returned the Infinity Stones to their rightful places in the timeline. Using the time machine Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) developed, Rogers set off during the movie's last act. However, audiences didn't get to witness the former Captain America drop into each of the stone's homes. Fans expected Disney to release a Director's Cut or deleted scenes on Blu-Ray depicting Steve's adventures through time, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. And we've still yet to learn what transpired.</p><h2 id=captain-america-returning-the-infinity-stones>Captain America Returning The Infinity Stones</h2><p>While there's no concrete answer, perhaps Disney plans to keep those last Endgame sequences a mystery until the time is right. Considering how many questions the absence raises, like what Rogers said to the Red Skull, the company may show the entire adventure in a different project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cap-YouTube-1.jpg><p>Cap and Red Skull have a storied history together, and encountering one another on a cosmic plane would prompt both to ask questions because the last time they saw each other, the latter got beamed into space. Then on top of that, the irony of Cap giving Hydra's former leader the same thing they fought so vigorously over during World War II would add another layer of complexity to their interactions.</p><p>Rogers' trip to return the Soul Stone is just one scene that should've been a simple decision to shoot. Of course, seeing as how the Russo Brothers neglected to do so, it may have been at Disney's behest. There are comprehensive plans going into Phase 4, and a retrospective exploring Cap's last mission makes sense. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Loki series</a> is backtracking to the events of 2012, so who's to say we won't witness more Endgame aftermath.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is The U.S. Agent From 'The Falcon And The Winter Soldier'?</a></span></p><p>Another reason fans should expect to see those Infinity Stone missions at some point is Captain America 4. While the director is presumably centering the fourth film around Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), this could be a splendid opportunity to close the book on Steve Rogers, too. Avengers: Endgame didn't officially wrap up his story, and the older Steve supposedly died in between the events of Endgame and Falcon and the Winter Soldier. The lack of visual confirmation in the Disney+ show makes us think a prologue sequence in Captain America 4 will take audiences to Rogers' bedside as he lies dying. Then having Cap regale Sam, Bucky, and his other friends with time-traveling adventures could segue into flashbacks of him putting the Infinity Stones back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hindrances>Hindrances</h2><p>Keep in mind, though, any chance of seeing Cap's last mission requires that Chris Evans be on board, and he's called it quits with Marvel. It wasn't over a dispute, like contracts or money. Evans is just moving on to pursue other projects. Kevin Feige also ruled out rumors of the actor reprising his role during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, making a return much less likely. But never say never.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-Evans-as-Captain-America-via-IndieWire.jpg><p>Maybe in a few years,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evans will want to give Steve Rogers another run</a>. That's just a guess, but a minor break may be all the actor needs. If that is the case, he might shoot those Infinity Stone missions. It wouldn't require much on Evans' part, just showing up and dressing the part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether or not the Cap's last mission is in the works, Disney should put serious consideration into it. Fans are still talking about the missing scene two years later, which is probably a sign they want to see it in its entirety. Disney will ultimately decide, but let's hope the company gives audiences what they're craving.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brie Larson Opens Up On The Immense Pressure Of Playing 'Captain Marvel'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoq6zwsSlZKmtoqW8tLHLsmSlnZGrsm6vwKmqZqSRqMFuucisqqKnnmK8tsCMqJ1mmaaau6ix0axknqaUnK6usY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
