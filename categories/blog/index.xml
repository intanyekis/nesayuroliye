業界人にもファンが多い野田洋次郎さんは、これまでに多くの女性と交際が噂されました。
そんなモテモテの野田洋次郎さんですが、過去に結婚が噂された女性はただ一人しかいません。
それは、有名な女優・吉高由里子さんです。
野田洋次郎さんは吉高由里子さんよ長く交際した末に破局。
多くのファンがお似合いの二人だと、結婚することを信じていましたが、まさかの破局に愕然としました。
しかし、その後に復縁が噂されることがあったりと、現在も関係は良さそうです。
今日は野田洋次郎さんと吉高由里子さんの馴れ初めから熱愛、そして破局から復縁の噂までをまとめて書いてみたいと思います。
また、RADWIMPSの問題曲「五月の蝿」が吉高由里子さんへの憎しみで書いたとされる噂についても検証してみたいと思います。
野田洋次郎と吉高由里子の馴れ初めから半同棲の熱愛報道 野田洋次郎さんと吉高由里子さんの出会いは2011年です。
2011年のRADのライブツアーの後に友人の紹介で知り合い、同年の後半から交際がスタートしたとされてます。
交際がスタートしたのは2011年ですが、野田洋次郎さんと吉高由里子さんの熱愛が報じられたのは2013年2月と1年以上ふたりの交際は世間にバレていませんでした。
野田洋次郎さんと吉高由里子さんの交際は2011年から2015年頃まで4年に及び続き、喧嘩や復縁、結婚、破局と状況に応じて詳細が報道されるほどに世間に注目されていました。
当時はRADWIMPSがメジャーデビューしてアルバムが売れ、名前が全国区になったばかりの時期。
吉高由里子さんも２０代前半から後半までの新人女優から大物女優にキャリアを伸ばした時期であり、ニュースター同士の交際だったということで、週刊誌の記者が常に張っているような状態でした。
小話でありますが、野田洋次郎さんが2011年に吉高由里子さんと熱愛報道が出るまでは臼田あさ美さんとの交際が噂され、吉高さんとの報道が出るまでは臼田あさ美さんと交際してると思われていました。
一部では洋次郎さんの二股、もしくは浮気が噂されましたが、その部分は不透明です。
喧嘩することがあっても仲良し？破局するも復縁 野田洋次郎さんと吉高由里子さんは、交際期間中に多くの記事が出ました。
特に印象的なのは二人が路上で喧嘩してるとの内容の記事です。
洋次郎さんと吉高さんが路上でどなり合いの大ゲンカをする姿を『FRIDAY』(講談社)に激写されたのです。
バーから出てきた後、帰路の途中で言い合いに。なんとか二人で帰宅するも、深夜３時には壁に物が当たる物騒な音が響いた
この喧嘩をする直前までは、笑い声が響くほど仲の良い様子だったとのことです。
おそらく、互いにお酒が入って酔っぱらって、いきなり険悪モードになったと思われます。
カップルならよくあることなので、「だから何？」ぐらいのリアクションでしたが、その後に破局したことが報じられファンに衝撃を与えてました。
一時は破局も噂されましたが、その後に復縁や半同棲が報じられました。
タイ料理店で食事を終えると、吉高がウキウキした顔で「『ロンバケ』見ながら、食べよ！」と言って春雨サラダをテイクアウト。2人揃って店からほど近い野田の自宅へと帰っていった。
そしてなんと、吉高はそのまま3日間、野田の自宅に連泊。
喧嘩して別れて復縁してと、不安定ながらも楽しそうに過ごしていたことがわかります。
お互いに結婚を意識していた？ 喧嘩しては復縁したり、週刊誌の格好のネタにされていた洋次郎さんと吉高さん。
和製シド&amp;amp;ナンシーのように、交際の成り行きが注目されていました。
2014年5月の『女性セブン』で復縁を報じられた時点で、ふたりは半同棲中で周囲からは結婚間近ともささやかれていました。
ハードスケジュールに余裕のなかった吉高さんですが、心にゆとりが出るとわずかな時間でも野田さんと一緒に過ごせるように半同棲状態の生活を送っていたそうです。
ビッグカップル夫婦の誕生が期待されました。
交際当時から吉高さんの事務所は交際に反対していたものの、吉高さんは「別れるぐらいなら、仕事辞める」と反発したほどに真剣な付き合いだったということです。
野田さんが2014年に出した「ラリル論」では、2014年2月21日の日記に、
〈今日はとことんダメ。気持ちがだめだめだめあの人に言われた。「わたしと別れたら誰とも結婚できないよ」最初はふざけんなと思った。でもそのうち本気でそう思った。もう歌を歌いすぎた。歌は消耗する。摩耗する。最後は終わった。もう賞味期限切れだ。メンバーと、メンバーの家族のために俺は生きる。〉
と吉高さんとの会話に「結婚」というワードがあったことを綴っています。
また、同じ日の日記には、知り合いの小さな子どもに「好きになっちゃった」と言われたことを綴り、
〈告白嬉しかったよ。忘れないよ。でも俺好きな人いるから、ごめんねって言っちゃったけど〉
と、吉高由里子さんへの愛情深さを表現した一文が書かれています。
野田洋次郎と吉高由里子の破局。理由は彼女の性格？ 2015年の2月に「FLASH」（光文社）で野田洋次郎さんと吉高由里子さんの破局が伝えられました。
野田さんのほうから吉高さんを振ったらしく、吉高さんの親友であるハリセンボンの近藤春菜さんらが”吉高を慰める女子会”を開いて慰めたとされてます。
前回、破局が伝えられた2013年の頃は、当時の破局の理由は日常的に繰り返される喧嘩だとされていました。
また同年秋にNHK連続テレビ小説『花子とアン』のヒロインに抜擢されたプレッシャーに押しつぶされ、吉高さんが野田さんに強く当たったことがあり、一旦ふたりで距離を取るために別れたとの憶測もありました。
2015年の破局の理由はなんだったのでしょうか？
破局する前年に野田さんが出した書籍の2014年2月22日の日記には、
〈終わりなら終わりってわかりたい。力を注いでいいなら注ぎたい。全力で。誰のためにも、誰の幸せにもならないことに、このただでさえ小さな、俺の全力は使えない。〉
と当時から別れを意識した心境が綴られています。
また、同年のツアーも終盤にさしかかった6月10日には、
〈好きだなぁと思う。好きで好きで、たまらないなぁと思う。とっても愛しくて、他の人に伝えたくなる。でも独り占めしたくなる。相反するようで、矛盾しない。幸せだなぁと思う〉
と今度は吉高さんへの熱烈な想いも綴られています。
破局の理由は基本的に吉高由里子さんの不安定な内情にあったとされていますが、野田洋次郎さんもそれなりに起伏が激しい部分があったのではないか？と言われています。
吉高由里子の精神状態。大仕事、ハードスケジュール、マネージャーの退社。 2015年4月に2人は同年年明けに半同棲を解消し破局したことを週刊誌『FLASH』に報じられました。
その報道の8日後に吉高さんが自身のツイッターに「軽蔑してるよ」と険しい表情をアップしました。
もともと喧嘩の多かったふたりですが、吉高さんに長年付き添ったマネージャーの退社が重なり、情緒不安定に陥ったことがトドメになったとの見解が強いです。
「ふたりともマイペースなタイプなので、もともとケンカはしょっちゅうだったんです。昨秋に吉高さんが『朝ドラ』のヒロインに決まってからは、彼女は大きなプレッシャーを感じてイライラすることが多くなって、さらにケンカも増えてしまい、別れてしまったんです」（吉高の知人）
吉高さんがずっと信頼してきた女性マネージャーが辞めてしまったこともあり、これまでに以上に吉高さんが情緒不安定になり、そんな彼女を野田さんは支えきれなくなったことが、大まかな破局の原因だとされてます。

それはSNSに疎いということ。
アリーナクラスのバンドマンであれば、積極的にインスタのアカウントを作ったりしますが、ドームクラスのバンドマンはなかなか作りません。
それは忙しいからなのか、影響力が強すぎて懸念してるのか、理由は色々とありますね。
ミスチルの桜井和寿さんは、音楽番組に出演さえすれば、かなり素朴で、飾らない発言が多かったりするので、仮に「言葉でなく文章で見たとき」に語弊が出そうにも思います。
桜井和寿とインスタグラムの歴史。コラボ動画やファッションや髪型の画像が人気！ 桜井和寿さんは90年代から女性ファンを多く抱え、界隈ではアイドル的存在です。
もちろん男性からも注目度が高く、髪型やファッションの面でトレンドに影響を与えることもあります。
インスタグラムでは桜井和寿さんの画像が身近に観れるようになりました。
過去に注目された共演やコラボ、または髪型やファッションなどが振り返られるので便利です。
現在の時点でインスタには桜井和寿さんに特化したアカウントが存在しており、多くのフォロワーを抱えています。
桜井和寿と他ミュージシャンの共演。ワンオクのTAKAなどとのツーショット 以前、ワンオクのTAKAさんと桜井和寿さんのツーショットが話題になりました。
未来のドームバンドが見え始めてるワンオクだけに、その新旧二人の横並びは贅沢でした。
今後、どこかのステージで桜井和寿さんとTAKAさんが共演されたら嬉しいです。
ワンオクの声は綺麗なハモリもいけると思うので、デュエットすれば、かなり良いハーモニーになりそうです。
ちなみにプライベートでも交友があるそうで、過去にはTAKAさんが桜井和寿さんらと食事に行ったことをインスタに投稿しました。
左から桜井和寿さん、TAKAさん、JINさんの３人です。
以前のツーショットは２０１７年４月のワンオクのライブに、桜井和寿さんがゲスト出演したときのものでしたが、きっと、そこから交友が生まれたのでしょうね！
桜井和寿とMISIAが「Bank Band」で共演。コラボ曲「forgive」 桜井和寿さんといえば、音楽家・小林武史さん共に結成したたBank Bandが有名ですね。
実は2021年には同ユニットで、ゲストボーカルにMISIAを迎えた新曲「forgive」を配信限定でリリースしました。
日本を代表するミュージシャンふたりのコラボだったということもあり、インスタでも話題になりました。
東北の大震災から10年という節目に、「次の未来」へ力強く漕ぎ出す歌「forgive」が完成。今作は2018年7月に配信リリースされた「MESSAGE - メッセージ-」に続くBank Band&amp;nbsp;5作目となるオリジナル曲。櫻井和寿が作詞、小林武史が作曲＆編曲、レコーディングには、小林武史（Key.）、櫻井和寿（Vo.）、小倉博和（Gt.）、亀田誠治（Ba.）河村“カースケ” 智康（Dr.）、四家卯大（vc.）、沖祥子（vn.）、山本拓夫（Sax.）、西村浩二（Tp.）らが参加し、コーラスには石巻好文館高等学校音楽部と石巻メンネルコールが参加している。
2021年3月11日「被災地と被災者の10年を想い、日本を力づけるアーティストたちの熱いパフォーマンスを届ける」TBS音楽特番『音楽の日』にて、同楽曲を初披露しました。
櫻井和寿コメント えんやこら
ここから
はじまるよ
あれから10年
それから今も
大きな流れの前では、小さくて不完全な僕らを
許しながら
それでもやっぱり未来へ力強く漕ぎ出す
そんな歌です
東北の方々の力に満ちた歌を、声を聞いて欲しいです。
櫻井和寿
MISIAコメント 東日本大震災から変わらず、東北へ心を寄せ、
活動を続けてきたお二人だからこそ生まれた歌だと思います。
「forgive」というメッセージを、今の時代に、今届ける。
その深い想いをしっかりと理解し、一緒に伝えられるよう心を込めて歌いました。
レコーディングは時間がなかったこともあり、皆さんとスタジオに集まり、
櫻井さん、小林さん、私と３つのスタジオで、それぞれがレコーディングしたものを
１つ１つ重ねていくような形で行われました。
完成形はミックス作業の時に聞くことになったのですが、
この歌を聞いた方の心を抱きしめるようイメージをして歌った私に対して、
櫻井さんの歌声は「行くぞー！みんな！」と、優しくも力強くひっぱっていくようで、
皆さんと一緒に歌い合って、今を共に乗り越えてゆき、共に笑いあうような、
そんなイメージがワッと広がりました。
次の未来への応援歌として、多くの皆さんへ届くことを願っています。

現在の桜井さんは笑顔が暖かい、”笑顔イケメン”であります。
温厚でかわいい雰囲気が、今の桜井和寿さんの魅力であります。
しかし、若い頃は割とバチバチとした表情が多かったです。
特に週刊誌に取り上げられることが多かった90年代は、人間不信のような殺気立ったオーラを身に纏っておりました。
