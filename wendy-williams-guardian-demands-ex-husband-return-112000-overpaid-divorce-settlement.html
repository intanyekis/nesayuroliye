He says in his motion papers… that he was paid through January of 2022," Morrissey wrote in her court filing. "As a result, [Kevin] has been unjustly enriched by the receipt of $112,500 ($37,500 x 3 months) belonging to [Wendy]."</p><p>In 2022, Williams was placed under court-ordered guardianship, entrusting Morrissey with the management of her financial affairs and she’s since largely stepped away from the spotlight, except for a documentary released this year that explored what happened to Williams, going into detail about her newly publicized health condition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morrissey’s filing ends with a request for the return of the funds to Wendy, simultaneously proposing a gag order to restrict her ex-husband from publicly speaking on the issue. Additionally, she advocated for the dismissal of Hunter's plea to reopen the case in court, proposing arbitration as an alternative resolution method.</p><p>In response, Hunter continues to argue for the resumption of payments, insisting on the disclosure of Wendy's financial records spanning from their divorce proceedings to the present to prove his point. The case remains ongoing.</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn’t the only financial problem Williams is dealing with.
