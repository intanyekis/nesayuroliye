It was difficult and agonizing, she explained.</p><p>“Agonizing. Every day and at all times. I spent as much time as I could with him. My stomach would churn every time I saw him slide away from me. It was true – I got sick from it because I was so depressed.”</p><p>Similarly, the actor’s wife of 25 years reported that Gene hadn’t said anything, but on the night he died, he looked her in the eyes and repeated “I Trust You” three times in a row.</p><h2><span id=Karen_Boyer8217s_husband_died_as_a_result_of_Alzheimer8217s_disease_complications>Karen Boyer’s husband died as a result of Alzheimer’s disease complications.</span></h2><p>On August 29, 2016, the legendary actor and director Gene Wilder died as a result of Alzheimer’s disease complications. At the time, he was 83 years old. The actor had been diagnosed with the cancer three years before but chose to keep it hidden from his fans. Similarly, his nephew stated in an interview,</p><p>“The decision to wait until this time to disclose his condition was not motivated by vanity, but rather by the desire to spare the countless young children who would smile or call out to him, ‘there’s Willy Wonka,’ from being exposed to an adult referencing illness or trouble, causing delight to shift to worry, disappointment, or confusion.” He couldn’t take the thought of one less grin in the world.”</p><h2><span id=Karen_Boyer_did_she_marry_after_her_husband_died>Karen Boyer, did she marry after her husband died?</span></h2><p>Karen Boyer did not marry after Gene Wilder died.
