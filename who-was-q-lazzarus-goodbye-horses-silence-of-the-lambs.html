Director Jonathan Demme boarded the singer’s cab and was serenaded by her demo track that played during the ride. That fateful encounter led to the Lazzarus’s music getting featured in Demme’s films, including a brief appearance in Philadelphia, where she rendered a cover of Talking Heads’ Heaven. However, Lazzarus went under the radar after her band's disbandment, leaving even her closest friends in the dark about her whereabouts. In July, the singer who<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> disappeared for decades passed away at 61</a>.</p><h2 id=q-lazzarus-was-a-member-of-a-band><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Q Lazzarus Was A Member Of A Band</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/299892384_434821868429367_2272450049998475672_n.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Goodbye Horses singer was a band member of the Q Lazzarus and the Resurrection; a five-member band that consisted of William Garvey, Janice Bernstein, Glorianna Galicia, Mark Barrett, and Diane Luckey.</p><p>The band members had their roles spelled out, with Garvey handling the songwriting and production, Lazzarus leading the vocals, and the rest of the band members supporting as backup singers.

Also, Lazzarus lived and worked as an au pair for an English businessman in the house where the band singers recorded their vocals.</p><h2 id=q-lazzarus-was-rejected-by-record-labels><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Q Lazzarus Was Rejected By Record Labels</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/280237983_146333794623832_2365650388820054242_n-(1).jpg><p>Lazzarus had big dreams of becoming successful and famous through her music. Unfortunately, those dreams did not see the light of day due to record labels' reluctance to take a chance on her. According to a band member, these labels considered Lazzarus unmarketable due to her hair. “I’m a big-boned African-American woman who wears dreads, sings American rock and roll – I market myself,’' she would say.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="Do Movie Soundtracks Really Make Artists Money?">Do Movie Soundtracks Really Make Artists Money?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-q-lazzarus-disappeared-for-years><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Why Q Lazzarus Disappeared For Years</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/299831781_570785388076266_2235099068062405940_n-(1).jpg><p>For nearly three decades, ‘<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What happened to Q Lazzarus</a>?’ and ‘Where is Q Lazzarus now?’ were constant questions on the lips of many who had come to appreciate her music.

Galicia entertained fears that the said man must have isolated Lazzarus, but that was far from the case. During her protracted break from the public glare, the singer started a family with her husband and children in Staten Island.</p><h2 id=q-lazzarus-had-a-short-musical-career><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Q Lazzarus Had A Short Musical Career</span></h2><p>Lazzarus’s musical career was short. The singer’s short stint in music and eventual disappearance is one of the most intriguing mysteries in music history. The New Jersey native broke into the limelight in the 80s with the release of Goodbye Horse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, she walked away from it all eight years after without an explanation.

You might think it impossible, but Lazzarus achieved this feat twice. In a similar manner with which she met Deeme, the singer made the acquaintance of filmmaker Eva Aridjis on a cab ride.</p><p>“I got into a car service Q was driving and after chatting with her for a few minutes I figured out that it was her," the filmmaker told Rolling Stone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=q-lazzarus-was-working-on-a-comeback><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Q Lazzarus Was Working On A Comeback</span></h2><p>Aridjis and Lazzarus considered their meeting a result of fate. The duo developed a close relationship for three years before the singer’s passing. Not only did the friends share a bond, but they began working on multiple projects shortly after they met, including a comeback concert and a documentary.</p><p>The documentary tagged Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus will capture the singer’s walk through life and feature her unreleased music as the soundtrack for the film.
