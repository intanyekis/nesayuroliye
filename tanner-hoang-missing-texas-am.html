Hoang, 22, is a student at Texas A&M University who had traveled to College Station that day with his family to attend a graduation ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>He went missing shortly before they were set to meet up for lunch and has not been seen since. Local authorities have launched a search operation in an effort to locate Hoang, while his loved ones are holding out hope he will eventually be found safe and sound.</p><p>Police are currently searching for Hoang, a 6-foot tall man of 175 pounds, who has brown hair and eyes. It is believed that he may have left the area in a silver car.&nbsp;</p><p>His family was in town to attend a graduation ceremony but he went missing before a previously scheduled lunch with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, they are asking people to be on the lookout for a 2009 Lexus ES350 with Texas plates BS2 C737 in case it is related to Hoang’s disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>If anyone has any information about this incident, Police would like them to contact their local law enforcement agency.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Hoang?</h2><p>Tanner Hoang was the pride and joy of his League City-based family. However, during Tanner’s time studying mechanical engineering at Texas A&M, his family hadn’t seen much of him—until recently.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to his inability to fulfill the graduation requirements, the Hoangs expect an earlier reunion with their beloved son and nephew.</p><p>Describing him as a fun-loving yet humble young man, Tuan Hoang invited parents everywhere to see why the Hoangs miss their hardworking son dearly in their home. If one thing can be said for sure—any parent would be proud to call Tanner their own.</p><p>Tanner Williams has been missing for over a week, and his family is clinging to the power of prayer in their desperate search for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Tuan Williams said, “<strong>We are just asking everybody to continue to pray – we believe in the power of prayer, and we are asking God to bring Tanner back to us</strong>.”&nbsp;</p><p>So far, the only sign of where Tanner maybe is the sighting of his car on Highway 21 near College Station and Caldwell, heading towards Bastrop. As part of the search effort, Amber Alert Network Brazos Valley has urged people to keep an eye out for Tanner’s silver Lexus with license plate BS2C737.&nbsp;</p><p>This powerful collective effort will hopefully lead us to Tanner very soon.</p><p>For many, the search for missing child Tanner Pritchard is a reminder that there are still resources to help those in need – even if the case does not meet the age requirements for an Amber Alert.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike Fleeger used to work for the College Station Police Department and now runs Amber Alert Network Brazos Valley, a nonprofit organization assisting with Tanner’s family.&nbsp;</p><p>Fleeger understands how devastating it can be when a loved one goes missing and wants to do whatever he can to bring them home.&nbsp;</p><p>“<strong>Bottom line, it’s somebody’s loved one who is not where they are supposed to be, so we want to do everything we can to get the word out to the public and help bring that loved one home</strong>,” said Fleeger.&nbsp;</p><p>The commitment of an organization like Amber Alert Network Brazos Valley may offer hope in desperate times and show families they are not alone.</p><p>Tanner’s family is hoping he returns home safely. They want to make sure he knows that despite his situation, they still love him and will support him no matter what.&nbsp;</p><p>His aunt Tuan stressed that there is not a single reason why their bond should be broken – “<strong>God loves him and there’s nothing he has done that would make us stop loving him</strong>”, she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She then urged anyone who may have seen Tanner to reach out and share the message of love from his family and extended family.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAwKelnqpdnbyiusZmpKKro567qHnTnq%2Baq12WunA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
