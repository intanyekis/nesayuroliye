His time at the Steelers’ training camp displayed not only his punting prowess but also his attempt to break into the league as a kick-off specialist. Notably, Dales brought back the straight-on style of placekicking, a technique unseen in the NFL since the 1980s.</p><p>Dales found his home with the Calgary Stampeders, signing as a free agent on March 8, 2005. His tenure with the Stampeders was highlighted by significant contributions, including being part of the team’s 96th Grey Cup victory in 2008. Despite contract negotiations and potential NFL interest, Dales remained loyal to Calgary, re-signing with the team in 2009.</p><p>After becoming a free agent in 2012, Dales continued his football journey by signing with the Edmonton Eskimos on February 19, 2012. However, his time with the Eskimos was followed by a release on July 22, 2013. The Montreal Alouettes came calling on October 30, 2013, marking a return for Dales to a familiar team. His illustrious career concluded when he announced his retirement on May 16, 2014.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqlp7imecOao56rXZi1qrjDq5ynZZSesW6u1KuinmWUlrmmv4yhmK%2BdXaC2pb%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
