But you gotta understand some people are alright with manipulation as long as they get something out of it. So I think them dudes know that. But I think they just cool with the situation. Sometimes people don’t got nothing going on in their life. They need to be a part of something.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in the interview, Tax also sent shots at N.O.R.E for what he describes as a willingness to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">generate numbers by any means</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s fools like the people who interview Troy Ave. They interview him ’cause they know he’s gonna talk about me. He has nothing going on … So it’s like the podcast game when I see what was going on.&nbsp;Like with N.O.R.E.&nbsp;He was on my podcast. And then for maybe two, three months straight, we was on the phone every day, six in the morning, five in the morning, two in the morning, putting together the ideas for&nbsp;Drink Champs,” Tax expressed. “At first just summed it up to N.O.R.E looking for numbers. He don’t care. Like, he’ll sacrifice anything.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Campbell’s remarks arrived a couple of days before <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Budden unleashed on Rory & Mal</a>. The duo had critiqued Complex’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>List of Hip-Hop Media Power Rankings</a> after the former emcee landed at No. 1, calling him a “thief” and a “cat burglar.” Joe sent shots at the two men, calling on them to address their shortcomings before talking about him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“To whom this may concern,” the 42-year-old started. “This is not even on page one of the manual, ’cause you ni**as ain’t in the bookstore. Instead of critiquing people’s placement on this list, we need more critiquing on why you’re not on it. To everyone not on it, shut the f**k up. There’s some steps that you ni**as have missed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“To whom it may concern, stop holding a microphone. I’m just giving out podcast advice. It’s certain ni**as, y’all can’t speak to me, y’all didn’t do the work yet. You didn’t go to the bookstore. Hire the editors. Get people to help. Invest in the staff. Pay the staff. Get more staff. Stop check chasing. Stop doing the bare minimum and expecting that to yield results. You ni**as are the bare minimum boys.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6muub%2FTqKWeZZOWua2%2FjKisrWWapLJurtSdm56mXae8s8WMppilZWFngHWDk3Btcm1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
