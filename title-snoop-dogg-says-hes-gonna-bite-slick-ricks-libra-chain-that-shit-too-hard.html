But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t leave a little room for fun.</p><p>On Wednesday (April 6), the<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener> new owner of the Death Row Records brand</a> posted a photo of himself in the studio with Slick Rick, wearing nine of the Hip Hop pioneer’s elaborate chains.&nbsp;In a follow-up video, Slick Rick tells Snoop to put his hood back on as he removes them one by one with Snoop singing, “Until the end of time, Rick would adorn me/Take off this gold of mine.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Snoop Dogg</a>&nbsp;also gets a little education on Slick Rick’s Africa piece from an unidentified woman in the video and zeros in on Rick’s Libra chain.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“This piece, I saw Rick draw this,” she says. “I don’t know Rick that long, but I was going through some of the archives of Rick’s and he drew this in 1980-something before he bought anything. Like in 1983, 84, he drew this and this.”</p><p>Snoop — who was born on October 20 — then points to the Libra piece and says, That’s so fucking dope. I’m getting this. I’m sorry, I gotta bite that. I’m a Libra, so I can. I got to bite that. That shit too hard.”</p><p><a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Slick Rick</a> showed off his massive jewelry collection in a 2019 interview with GQ and talked about what it was like before he could actually afford a chain.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Back in the days, when rappers used to start off, we used to have to borrow the jewelry before we could purchase it,” he said. “So, that’s why you hear a lot of rumors where they say, ‘You don’t own that. You don’t own this. You borrow it. Da da da.’ Back in the days you’d say that a lot. But it was true. But it’s not a bad thing; it’s just you have to sell yourself like ‘Cinderella.’”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2021/11/KiTT_Slick-Rick-Retouched-5.11-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>From Slick Rick & LL COOL J To Salt-N-Pepa & Run-DMC: Janette Beckman's 'Rebels' Book Has Hip Hop Covered</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>November 17, 2021</p></a><p>He later explained where he thinks the jewelry trend started, saying, “Well, I’ve been in this jewelry game for a minute. Since the very beginning. You know, the only people that were before people like me and Rakim and Eric B. and them cats, was like Mr. T. So, Mr. T was our role model, before us.” He also cited singer&nbsp;Sammy Davis, Jr. as another inspiration too, especially displaying rings while holding the microphone.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Check out the video below.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZmboB2go6toK2klWPAr7vOqWSdp5ecerSt2KxkoZ2jYrSwus2aZJuhpJp6tLjInKJmqpmYuLR5y6KZq5ldmLWitc1mq6GZpGLAqbXTZquop12drrOw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
