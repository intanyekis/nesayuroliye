Tammie, to whom he’d been married since 2003, filed for divorce earlier this year after accusing him of infidelity.</p><p>Allegedly, the two had an argument and staff helped calm it down. Later, they reportedly had another altercation and the 49-year-old locked her out of his room.</p><p>Tammie called the police around 5am because she was worried about his safety. Officers found him hanged in the bathroom after being let into his room by staff.</p><p>His representative said, ‘Please respect the privacy of his family and friends during this horrible time as we come to terms with the loss of such a wonderful human being. He loved his family, friends and fans very much. He will truly be missed.’</p><p>The actor’s family has yet to make a statement. He is survived by his four children – Hunter, Jacob, Skye, and Jenna.</p><p>Frank was best known for portraying Tommy Oliver on the original run of the ‘Mighty Morphin Power Rangers’ show, which debuted in 1993.</p><p>“`</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xminqK%2BVp3qzrc2gnKurXajBor6Mo5isp55isaLCyJ1kn6qRo7hutMCdZJplkpbBtbjEZq6irJhiuqa605qjZqCVlrm1tIyapZ1lkqTCtb%2BMqJ1mnJWlv6a%2F0qKmp2WSmrOwvsRmn6KrXaq7tbXMnqOyZZSarrW0jJqrZmxpZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
