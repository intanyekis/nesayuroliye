The 20 year-old model rocked it out in the slinky shoes that wrapped around her leg like a snake. Her poor toes looked like they were in so much pain and were practically sliding out of the sandals. They did go perfectly with the&nbsp;<strong>Ralph & Russo</strong> couture gown that was absolutely stunning.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Bella had a little bit of a wardrobe malfunction with the dress as it exposed slightly more of the model than she might have wanted. She handled it like a pro, of course! Her silver dress was embellished with silver crystals and beads that looked incredible against the sheer fabric. Bella‚Äôs train was absolutely show-stopping and went at least two feet behind her. It was so incredibly elegant on the grey carpet. She wrapped up the look with a slick bun with an edgy bit of her hair sticking out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The model seemed to have a blast at the iconic event. She even got a lick on her neck from <strong>Nicki Minaj</strong>! ‚Äú#BreakTheInternet with my Bella üëÖ @bellahadid #VampireInCannes,‚Äù Nicki playfully captioned her flirty Instagram. Bella even had a chance to chat with the one and only&nbsp;<strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>, 42. She hung out with the Academy Award-winning actor along with&nbsp;<strong>Rita Ora</strong> and<strong> Shanina Shaik</strong>. Leo has been coming off a relationship with <strong>Nina Agdal</strong>, 25.
