"I just don't want that for our son. I don't want him growing up thinking it's normal to live like that."</p><p><strong>"Jax did not cheat on me, but we got into a very bad fight and I decided to pack up my stuff and I've been staying in an Airbnb since January 24,"</strong> she added, revealing that they had been separated long before they shared it with the world. "The only reason that I felt like I had to announce was because the Instagram sleuths literally realized that I was staying at a different house and rumors started spinning going crazy everywhere."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This decision probably wasn't easy, especially considering that the couple share a young son, but it was ultimately the best for everyone involved.</p><h2 id=brittany-and-jax-were-recently-spotted-together>Brittany And Jax Were Recently Spotted Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/brittany-cartwright-jax-taylor.jpg><p>Despite the separation, the estranged couple seem to be keeping things cordial. <strong>A few days ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jax Taylor was spotted at Brittany Cartwright's rental home</a>, and although they kept their distance, they acted pretty domestic. She was carrying the mail and a pile of clothes, while he took out her trash bins for her</strong>.</p><p>It's important to note that the pair aren't necessarily headed toward divorce. In fact, when she announced the separation, Brittany said that they were taking some time apart. "I'm doing it for my mental space," she said, "and I feel very strong with my decision to get out for a while."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jax-Taylor.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="This Is Jax Taylor's Life After 'Vanderpump Rules'">This Is Jax Taylor's Life After 'Vanderpump Rules'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jax Taylor may not be in season 9 of 'Vanderpump Rules,' but his life with wife, Brittany Cartwright and son, Cruz hasn't slowed down one bit.</p><p>Although she's still open to working things out, Brittany Cartwright has made peace with the fact that splitting up for good is a possibility. <strong>"I don't really have much fight left in me. We're separated, we're trying to work it out," she said, but the important thing is not where they will end up as a couple, but what that will mean to their son</strong>.</p><p>"He's number one and we both agree on that," Brittany added.
