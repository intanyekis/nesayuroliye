Her head was the scariest part as her face had bulging black speckled eyeballs while her mouth was crusted over and had dried blood dripping out of it. North styled her incredible makeup with a baggy black T-shirt dress with orange graphic patterns it as well as a cropped, zip-up shoulder-length sweatshirt.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Aside from her head, her arms also had makeup on them to look like alien hands.
