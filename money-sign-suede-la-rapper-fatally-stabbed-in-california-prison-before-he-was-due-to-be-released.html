Prison officials for the Correctional Training Facility in Soledad said that the death of MoneySign Suede, 22, â€” whose real name is Jaime Brugada Valdez â€” is being investigated as a homicide after discovering he was absent from a headcount check on Tuesday, April 25, around 9.55 pm.&nbsp;</p><p>According to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> TMZ</a>, the 'Back to the Bag' rapper was found unresponsive in another area of the prison.
