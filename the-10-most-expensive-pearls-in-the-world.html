When a foreign substance passes into the oyster between the mantle and the shell, the mantle becomes irritated. In order to protect itself the organism coats this irritant with a substance called nacre, the same substance with which it builds its shell. Layers of nacre eventually form a pearl. While white pearls appear to be the most popular, they are produced in a variety of colours including pink, green, blue, grey and black. Black pearls are indigenous to the South Pacific.&nbsp; Known as the Queen of Gems, pearls are renowned for their iridescence, radiance and their natural beauty.&nbsp; They have been used as decorative items as far back as 5th century BC. The rarity of natural pearls meant that they were reserved for the rich and powerful. They were one of the first gems adorned by women and over time pearls became something of a status symbol personifying wisdom, power and wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pearls conjure up images of some of the world’s most iconic female figures including Cleopatra. In order to prove that Egypt occupied a legacy and wealth that rendered it unconquerable, Cleopatra bet Mark Anthony that she could host the most expensive dinner in history. So she laid a table with bare plates and filled some glasses with wine. Removing one of her pearl earrings she allowed it to dissolve into her glass of wine and drank it, winning the wager. One gemmologist has estimated that the monetary value of Cleopatra’s pearl earring would be the equivalent of over $9 million today. Among Cleopatra’s fellow adorners of pearls are royals, Anne Boleyn – who wore a strand of pearls with a gold ‘B’ pendant around her neck – and Queen’s Elizabeth I and II of England.&nbsp; Other famous adorners of pearls include <a title="Elizabeth Taylor Net Worth" href=#>Elizabeth Taylor</a>, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, <a title="Audrey Hepburn Net Worth" href=#>Audrey Hepburn</a> and Coco Chanel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-pierre-cartier-1-million><b>10.
