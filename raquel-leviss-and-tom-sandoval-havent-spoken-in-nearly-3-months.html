While both Raquel and Sandoval said they loved each other during part 3 of the Pump Rules season 10 reunion, which filmed in March and aired in June, their romance has since cooled.</p><p>Earlier this week, Sandoval shocked fans when he <a href=#>left a public comment</a> on Raquel’s Instagram video taken at a flower farm.</p><p>“Happy birthday Rachel, I really hope ur finding peace and happiness,” he wrote on Tuesday, September 12, using Raquel’s legal name. “Miss u friend.”</p><p>Raquel, however, didn’t seem to appreciate the birthday message. Later that day, she shared a screenshot of Sandoval’s account via her Instagram Story, showing that the <a href=#>page is now blocked</a>. She added an “OK bye” sticker to the post.</p><p>In the wake of the blocking, the source tells Us that Raquel is being more mindful of who she surrounds herself with.</p><p>“It seems that [Sandoval] can’t keep her name out of his mouth and let her move on in peace,” the insider said. “She spent months at the facility doing nothing but <a href=#>taking accountability</a> for her actions and learning what drove her decisions in addition to giving multiple apologies. A large part of her mental health journey is leaving behind toxic people, especially those with questionable intentions towards her.”</p><p>Sandoval, however, defended his birthday message while speaking with Variety at the season 2 premiere of Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test in Los Angeles on Wednesday, September 13.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tom-Sandoval-Snuck-In-Photos-of-Raquel-Leviss-to-Special-Forces-According-to-Costar-Nick-Viall-3.jpg><p>“I just wished her a happy birthday. I didn’t think she had a lot of people reach out to her, so I wanted to. I mean, if she’s working on herself, I <a href=#>think it’s a little immature</a> — it’s a little thirsty — to post that,” the TomTom cofounder told the outlet.</p><p>Sandoval added that when he learned that Raquel had blocked him, he thought, “‘OK, whatever. Maybe her parents were going to dock her allowance this week or something.’”</p><p>Sandoval also claimed while speaking to Extra at the Special Forces premiere that Raquel was “in Arizona” for her birthday on September 12, which the source told Us isn’t true.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Rachel was not actually <a href=#>in Arizona</a> like Sandoval claimed, further supporting that they have not spoken and he has no idea about anything she does or where she is,” the insider said. “Rachel is currently on a cross-country road trip visiting friends for the last two weeks and is still continuing. She celebrated her birthday in the Pacific Northwest and went hiking [and] biking.”</p><p>Raquel is in her “healing era,” per her Instagram bio, and <a href=#>decided not to return</a> for <a href=#>season 11 of Pump Rules</a>, which Sandoval and the rest of the cast have already begun filming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmaGqsq15y56toqujYq6vsIytpqZlo5a7pbvVmqNmoJGrsq%2FAjKynqKOVo3qquoynnJqqnK56dHnMqKWtoKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
