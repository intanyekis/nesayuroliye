How do we know? That’s our secret. Kidding — it’s really just that you clicked into this article, or someone sent it to you knowing it was right up your alley. But still, most of us have been taking part in that same search. We need a pair of pants we can wear year round — a pair comfier than denim but more sophisticated than <a href=# data-link=1>sweats</a>.</p><p>Sure, there are trousers and slacks out there, but they’re usually much too stuffy. The pants we’re looking for can work for the office, yes, but they should also look totally natural in beach or brunch settings. We’re going to be a little picky here too, because we also want them to be comfy enough to work as loungewear. What? We’re high-maintenance and we’re not ashamed of it. We don’t need a $500 pair of pants to make Us happy though, just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one that hits all the marks</a>.
