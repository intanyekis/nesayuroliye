The handsome actors showed off their<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> chiseled biceps</a> while wearing tank tops in a brand new promo shot released on Thursday, July 27&nbsp; for their upcoming film, The Iron Claw. As seen below, Zac, 35, and Jeremy, 32, sat on a white fence in the photo, while their co-stars, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harris Dickinson</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stanley Simons</strong></a>, stood against the fence. Zac showed some brotherly love by placing his arm around Harris, while Jeremy wrapped his arm around Stanley’s neck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iron-Claw-Zac-Efron-Jeremy-Allen-White-a24-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The foursome stars in the <strong>Sean Durkin</strong>-directed film, which is based on the true story of the Von Erich family. The famous family of professional wrestlers were on top of the world in the early 1980s but got hit with one tragedy after the next. It was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced</a> on Thursday that The Iron Claw&nbsp;will debut for Christmastime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iron-Claw-Zac-Efron-Jeremy-Allen-White-a24-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jeremy previously <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed</a> he planned to gain 40 lbs. of muscle mass for the role. He’s been the talk of the town as of late for his lead role in The Bear, in which he plays the show’s protagonist, Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, a hunky chef. He also made headlines in mid-July for shirtless post-workout photos of him that were taken in Los Angeles. Check out one of the steamy pics of him below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Meanwhile, Zac notably bulked up for his role in 2017’s<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Baywatch film</a>. And although his arms are certainly looking in tip-top shape for The Iron Claw, he likely did not go as hard in the gym for the film. He previously admitted&nbsp;that after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Baywatch</a>, he “fell into a pretty bad depression” and developed insomnia once his intense training ended. “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>That Baywatch look</a>, I don’t know if that’s really attainable,” he explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Men’s Health</a> in 2022. “There’s just too little water in the skin. Like, it’s fake; it looks CGI’d. And that required Lasix, powerful diuretics, to achieve. So I don’t need to do that. I much prefer to have an extra, you know, 2 to 3 percent body fat.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He shared the same sentiment while chatting with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> in 2019. “That’s too big,” he said. “For guys, that’s unrealistic. I’m telling you. I got very big and buff for that movie, but I don’t want people to think that’s the best way to be.&nbsp; … I don’t want to glamorize this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FwZrOZk2Kyp77Op2SjnaKaurp5wKWjnqZdrLWqwMRmpK6rk6GytHnIq6anZZOhrrh5zKitop1dpbWwwM5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
