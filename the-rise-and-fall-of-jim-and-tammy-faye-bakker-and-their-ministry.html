They took it from a local ministry on Park Road in Charlotte to televangelism's national stage beamed around the world from their Heritage USA ministry in Fort Mill.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The shows and their lifestyles were lavishly&nbsp;built with money from those who donated millions to help the PTL ministry grow.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><strong><a href=#>['Divinely Unfaithful': ABC's '20/20' highlights </a></strong><strong><a href=#>story</a></strong><strong><a href=#> of Jim & Tammy Faye Bakker]</a></strong></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">In 1987, a scandal involving the Bakkers and the ministry came to light.&nbsp; The ministry had paid former church secretary Jessica Hahn who'd had a sexual encounter with Jim Bakker.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Jim Bakker abruptly resigned from The PTL and Jerry Falwell stepped in.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Following that, a federal grand jury indicted Jim Bakker and some of his top aides on mail and wire fraud charges.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Jim Bakker was convicted and sent to prison in 1989 after a highly publicized trial.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">He was released five years later, wrote a book and apologized and told broadcast journalist Barbara Walters he was done with televangelism.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Jim Bakker is currently hosting a new show in Branson, Missouri, where he still preaches and seeks donations.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Jim got out of prison and went to work,” former bodyguard Don Hardister said. “I mean, what's wrong with that? That's all he knows to do. That's his calling in life. So, it's no shock to me that he's doing it, and I think he's doing it quite well, once again.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Parts of the place he left behind in Fort Mill have been rebuilt, while others remain crumbling monuments to a television ministry that had created a Christian Camelot and ultimately collapsed in a pile of broken promises.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Former PTL band member Russell DeShields played music with several celebrities for the ministry.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I counted myself blessed just to be among some of these folks,” DeShields said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">He was crushed when the scandal broke.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“It was tough,” he said. “I mean, it was because it was a family.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Thirty years later, DeShields said it’s easy to see the problems that would bring PTL and Jim Bakker down.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The biggest problem may have been that no one would tell Jim Bakker, “No.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Don't get me wrong,” he said. “There were some great people around him, wonderful people. But sometimes it's hard to say, ‘We, probably shouldn't do that.’ It was tough.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><strong>Read more top trending stories on&nbsp;<a href=#>wsoctv.com</a>:</strong></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">Cox Media Group</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te9OhnGaqmaiybq3NnWSfmZyherCyjKOgpmWRo7FuwMCmpLJllpbGpnnBmqKknaJirq%2BwjK2fnqGiYrqqusisq6uxX259d4KSaW9qbF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
