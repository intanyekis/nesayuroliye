At first glance, the question seems like the opening line to a cringy musical joke. It definitely doesn’t seem like a request for a genuine comparison. This is no insult to Ms. Swift, who has generated an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated $400 million dollars</a> thanks to her tremendous popularity. But the fact remains that Mr. McCartney is considered one of the best musicians to ever live, and Ms. Swift is no Beatle. So, again: what could possibly make these performers similar?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ms. Swift’s Twitter account</a>, the unlikely pair actually gets along just fine. They will even be featured together on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the cover of this&nbsp;month’s</a>&nbsp;Rolling Stone.&nbsp;Perhaps this is a controversial choice on the part of the magazine, but as far as Ms. Swift is concerned, the young singer is in heaven.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul McCartney Leads Tribute To John Lennon As The Late Legend Turns 80</a></span></p><h2 id=mccartney-s-continued-charm>McCartney’s Continued Charm</h2><p>The young country and pop singer was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not afraid to express her joy</a> at being featured alongside one of our favorite Beatles. As she told her followers on Twitter, “Paul McCartney is the loveliest person alive.” That’s some pretty high praise, and well-deserved on the part of the British artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her post, Ms. Swift admits that the photoshoot for the cover was actually the first time she ever encountered Mr. McCartney in a one-on-one setting. Unfortunately for the young artist, their meeting did not last a particularly long time, as the interview and photo op&nbsp;lasted for only one day. Nevertheless, the experience has clearly had a lasting impression on Ms. Swift, thanks to her enthusiastic tweet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Paul McCartney’s $1 Billion Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=credit-where-it-s-due>Credit Where It’s Due</h2><p>While the choice to pair these two singers together may not seem obvious, Ms. Swift and Mr. McCartney have some striking similarities. In a time when most performers are simply, well, performers; both singers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actually write their own songs</a>. The&nbsp;RollingStones report also credits Ms. Swift with doing her own makeup. In the twenty-first century this kind of “low-maintenance” artist is increasingly rare.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two also noted that their pre-pandemic plans were actually quite similar. Both were initially scheduled to play at the Glastonbury music festival. They also adjusted to quarantine in the same fashion: by recording an album at home.</p><p>Perhaps, the duo is more similar than what meets the eye.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What Paul McCartney’s Children Are Doing Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahsGaska65sL6MrK6inqRiubDCxKxkqZmloXqur8Kaqa2mla58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
