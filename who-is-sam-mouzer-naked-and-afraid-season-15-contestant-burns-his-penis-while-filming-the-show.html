Sam Mouzer on Discovery's '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Naked and Afraid</a>' was in severe pain after his penis burned.</p><p>The upcoming season of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery's reality TV series</a> 'Naked and Afraid' will put survivalists' abilities to the test in unexpected ways. The show places pairs of participants, including a professional hiker and an MMA fighter, in some of the world's hardest environments and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges them to live for 21 days</a> without food, drink, or clothing. Season 15 offers a number of firsts for the show, including two people attempting to become the first foreigners to live 21 days in a remote section of the United States and two of the show's medics struggling for survival in front of the camera. However, one contender has already piqued the interest of spectators.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>How did Melanie Rauscher die? 'Naked and Afraid' contestant found dead in Arizona home</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Naked and Afraid' Season 15: 5 things to know about the reality series on Discovery</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Sam Mouzer?</h2><p>Sam Mouzer, 38, works as a mental health support worker in Brierley Hill, England. He has been married to Eleanor Jayne Mouzer for about 17 years and has two children. Sam joined the British Army as a reconnaissance officer after graduating from Thorns Community College. He then worked in retail at Games Workshop. Sam has re-established himself as a mental health support worker, living with his wife Elle, and his two sons, ages 12 and 20.</p><p>Elle stated, "I am just glad he is back in one piece, I am just happy he did it and survived it. I will be watching on TV like everyone else to see how he got on." Sam leads a Facebook fan group for the program and auditioned for a series some years ago. However, in February 2022, he was approached by producers and requested to participate. The shoot took place in August of last year.</p><h2 class=split>Sam returned home with burns on his penis</h2><p>The UK native's penis, which he described as his "little soldier's helmet," got burned when a fire pit was being fanned for heat at the remote filming location, in the desert of New Mexico. As shown in a video acquired by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, Sam and his co-contestant Lilly Jammerbund were dozing by the open flame while naked.</p><p>The terrified father-of-two yelped as excruciating heat crept up his private regions. Sam, on the other hand, didn't have to suffer in pain for long since on-set medics were able to treat his burns. He apparently kept his calm and joked through the anguish as the medical professionals worked their magic.</p><p>Season 15 of 'Naked and Afraid' premieres on Sunday, February 19. The show is also available to watch on Discovery+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKyYpmWdpMK7sdFmpZqjlZl6orrDZpifqpGesW6%2FxJqqqKZdZoJur86nq56rpJa7tXnBrqmnq12dtrR5z56loqtdrLWquMRmnaKknZ67qHnToZxmq5ikxA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
